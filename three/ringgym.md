<p>From the company that brought you your favorite doorbell delivery and dash moments comes the new <b class="sans">Ring</b><b class="bold">GYM</b> , ding-dong! Because we believe <b class="bold">stronger</b> communities are the key to safer neighborhoods, <b class="sans">Ring</b><b class="bold">GYM</b>   delivers the same intensity you watch every day through your smart doorbell but now as a workout. Sign up today! Each <b class="sans">Ring</b><b class="bold">GYM</b> <b class="stretch">neighborhood</b> <b class="bold">NETWORK</b>  features exercises that were crafted from the best local on-camera deliveries, motion-triggered activities, and security history. Get <b class="bold">strong</b>, stay safe, and never leave home! From the comfort of <i>inside</i>, follow along with <b class="sans">Ring</b><b class="bold">GYM</b> <b class="stretch">BODYBUILDERS</b> as they perform popular workouts <i>outside</i> like “6 Pack with 6 Pack Abs,” “Suspicious Standing,” or “Same-Day Delivery-Squats.” Building <b class="sans">Ring</b><b class="bold">GYM</b> <b class="stretch">BODIES</b> to build safer <b class="sans">Ring</b><b class="bold">GYM</b> <b class="stretch">neighborhoods.</b></p>

<p>Under the guise of safety and security, smart doorbells now collect and share motion-triggered activities with the public and law enforcement. Extending the front porch into public space, smart doorbells have created an active broadcasting stage where human bodies bend, drop, place, hide, wait, run, and generate evidence on command by those who can afford to remain inside. Appropriating the "home workout," <b class="sans">Ring</b><b class="bold">GYM</b>  is a parody in app form, but it is also an app that you can <b class="bold">actually</b> work out to. Launch <b class="sans">Ring</b><b class="bold">GYM</b>, navigate the <b class="stretch">neighborhood</b> <b class="bold">NETWORK</b> workouts, and follow along with a virtual <b class="sans">Ring</b><b class="bold">GYM</b> <b class="stretch">BODYBUILDER</b> using your webcam to experience these warped visions of the “outside” — scenes of conjecture, capitalism, and crime. As a form of simulation and imitation, <b class="sans">Ring</b><b class="bold">GYM</b>  creates virtual exercises from real videos collected by smart doorbells to elucidate the power structures, privacies, and labors from outside the home and bring them inwards.</p>
