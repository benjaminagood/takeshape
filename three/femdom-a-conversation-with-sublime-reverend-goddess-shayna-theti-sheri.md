_Content warning: The following interview depicts the social exclusion of trans people, particularly trans women._

From 1996 to 2008, a micronation called the [Other World Kingdom (OWK)](https://web.archive.org/web/20090913061412/http://www.owk.cz/philosophy-operation/whoweare/index.php) occupied a renovated sixteenth-century castle in a rural part of the Czech Republic. The OWK was ruled, according to their founding charter, as an “absolutist slave monarchy on the basis of a _Matriarchy.”1_ <span>Opinions within the BDSM community differ on race play and whether white and non-Black Dominants and submissives should use terms like “slave” and “slave auction” to describe kink play. These terms are prevalent in many BDSM spaces, and their use often goes unquestioned, particularly in spaces that are mostly white and/or primarily controlled by white people. However, the dynamic is not so simple for many Black kinksters. Some people intentionally choose the terms “Dominant/submissive” rather than “Master/slave” in recognition of the racist legacy behind the latter terminology. Gender theorist [Ariane Cruz](https://nyupress.org/9781479827466/the-color-of-kink/) has written extensively about the ways that race play can feel problematic and harmful in many contexts, but can also be a powerful tool of sexual reclamation for Black kinksters.</span> Men were “slaves” and the entire nation submitted to the designs of a single queen: Patricia the First. The ritual behaviors inside the OWK closely followed the practices of bondage, domination, sadism, and masochism (BDSM), banning penetrative sex acts themselves. Power lay in strict control without a gratifying release, a total surrender to the will of another in a space of mystery and pageantry. Paying visitors were known within the kingdom as “male slaves” and were escorted by “Sublime Ladies.” Men went to the kingdom to have themselves ritually undone through the strict theatrical control of their behavior by Queen Patricia the First and her women _citizens.2_ 

> Both the original OWK and its Second Life reconstruction adopted a binary view of gender that was limited to cis men and cis women, and largely excluded trans and nonbinary people. As Shayna discusses in this interview, while the online version of OWK occasionally allowed trans women to join, they were not welcomed in the space and didn’t make up a regular part of the OWK community. In addition, discriminatory practices such as voice verification likely prevented many women from joining in the first place.

After the physical kingdom closed, a group of fans and former citizens recreated its likeness and social structure virtually. This interview is with Sublime Reverend Goddess Shayna Theti-Sheri, the project manager of the [OWK in Second Life (SL)](http://alphavilleherald.com/2009/03/the-history-of-owk-in-sl-part-i.html) replication _project.3_ 

> Second Life awards honorific custom usernames to popular users on the platform. Shayna Theti-Sheri was not Shayna’s original username. When she amassed more than ten-thousand followers, she was bestowed an honorific title and allowed to change her username to her real-life dominatrix name. 

As curator of the Second Life project, Shayna collaborated with a group of Lady Senators and OWK slaves throughout the digital reconstruction process. This interview took place within [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/), where my avatar—the game’s generic “male” skin that wears a seventies disco shirt and holds a boombox—was whisked away from the starting stage via an inworld teleport. From a platform in the sky, I spoke with her Demon Succubus avatar about architecture, gender, ritual, capital, and copyright in cyberspace.

**Ian Erickson:**

How did you first learn about the OWK? Have you ever been to the physical OWK castle complex in the Czech Republic?

**Shayna Theti-Sheri:**

I was introduced to BDSM at a very early age, using a 300-baud modem and dialing into online services pre-broadband. I met people on a local online bulletin board and they invited me to a _“munch.”4_ A _munch_ is a casual social gathering for people involved in or interested in BDSM. ▲ Shortly after, I left for college, went to Minnesota, and received my first degree before returning to Florida, where I grew up. At that point I started to hang out with my friends again, learned more about the lifestyle and became the Dominant Female that I am today. I met my future ex-husband on a bulletin board system (BBS), and we ended up buying it. I stayed in the lifestyle for a while, eventually fell in love, got married, had children, and ended up working for a religious entity. This made it difficult to practice my dominance in public. Around 2003, in my late thirties, right about when my children went to school, I began exploring online. By 2005 I had an online group of subs and slaves working with me to complete my goals. Being a very goal-driven businesswoman, I was making an empire online just with _my radio station.5_ If you want to know the radio station’s web address, email [Shayna.](mailto:shaynapaine@gmail.com) ▲ That was when I discovered the Czech Republic’s OWK.  
  
In 2006 I spoke to the real-world OWK about playing the radio station in the background of their sessions, and they did end up using it as a backdrop occasionally. At that time, I was involved on a BDSM website and met a woman there who told me about Second Life. Myself, and a few of my slaves went and investigated it. We ended up making money in Second Life and developed approximately 6 × 16 acres of land. People were using the radio station as in-game background music in Second Life, and we also had land for rent. In 2007 or so, Michaal Ultsch came into Second Life to establish an OWK _presence.6_ Michaal Ultsch was the Second Life identity used by a real-life slave secretary of the physical OWK. ▲ Myself and about eight other women decided to get together and help him. We formed the Lady Senators—this counsel was organized to make decisions for OWK in SL. In the beginning of the OWK in SL, it really looked nothing like the physical Other World Kingdom. For the next eight months, the Lady Senate opened up and ran the OWK in SL working alongside Michaal. Most of my resources in Second Life were put into the project. I helped produce the graphics and built things as Michaal requested. In 2008 he came to the Lady Senate and told us that the real-world OWK did not want him in Second Life. The OWK in SL was moved, and my group, along with my then real-life husband, created a condensed virtual replica of the real-world Other World Kingdom. We maintained a roleplay there with the help of some of the women who were actually involved with the real-world OWK.  
  
Unfortunately, I was never able to visit the physical Other World Kingdom. I had planned to, but it closed before I had the opportunity.

**I:**

What was the relationship between the OWK in SL community and [the owk.cz online forum](http://www.owk.cz/) associated with the physical micronation? What was the motivation for starting the OWK in SL community?

**S:**

The website really had nothing to do with the OWK in SL. The OWK in SL group was established for members: you had to pay a fee to join. Many people who were involved in the online version were able to live out fantasies they couldn’t in the real world. It gave people the experience, in part, of what they wished to do in real life. A lot of people would like to be in the lifestyle and weren’t able to do it in person for whatever reason. In Second Life, they were able to experience it both mentally and visually online.

**I:**

How did you coordinate the different types of laborers involved in building the Second Life version, and what was the importance of starting the digital reconstruction with the sewers? How was the complex laid out and used?

**S:**

I had a group of about twenty people with different talents help me create the OWK in SL. People supplied us with blueprints, and we used the owk.cz website to obtain pictures of items that we chose to replicate. The process began with making a mountain that we then carved sewers and a prison into, and then we embedded a working security system. Residents of SL who wanted to roleplay as a slave in the prison system would be brought into the prison via boat. They entered the site through a massive waterfall where they were stripped, hosed down, examined, and checked in. Some of the roleplay included interrogations. In the prison where the slaves had to do work were items: a sponge, toothbrush, and a mop bucket to clean the floors or clean up the sewers. They also were put into solitary when they disobeyed. They used notecards to put out a warrant on the slave, and when they were captured and processed, the Judge would get the orders and court would be in session.  
  
On top of that all, we recreated the castle itself. The castle included the queen’s bedroom, the throne room (including a replicated version of Queen Patricia the First’s throne from the physical OWK), a dining area, the Lady Senate meeting area, the courthouse where slaves were sentenced, the pillory where they were publicly punished, and an upstairs ballroom. Next to the castle was a guesthouse and longhouse, which had a kitchen, a pool, and _Club Wanda.7_ Club Wanda was the nightclub embedded in the physical OWK complex. ▲ Behind the castle, there was a clinic for medical play and an amphitheater for slave auctions and entertainment. Behind that was a big path that went down into the valley, where there was a riding stable, a dog kennel, a marketplace, and finally a dock. You could take a boat around the whole _simulated island.8_ Thomas More’s _Utopia_ (1516) was also an island. ▲

**I:**

What compromises were made when you brought the original OWK layout into the SL setting?

**S:**

The architecture was modeled as closely as possible. Though, in the prison, we had to add a spiral staircase to get between levels more easily. In Second Life, you also have to build interiors really big in order to be able to cam from the back of your avatar comfortably, so a lot of the buildings were _scaled up.9_ In the game your avatar walks around in a third-person view, unless you go into “mouselook.” You need to have the structure big enough to be able to see—otherwise, you will only see outside the building because of the camera’s placement behind your avatar’s body. ▲  
  
Second Life itself made some adjustments to what we built through software updates. In 2009 the economy crashed, and we lost one of the core members of the community, who was working there every day as a greeter. The whole group was grieving his loss, as he had died in real life, and we had an online memorial for him in SL. We decided at that time, because of the economy and our loss, to close all the simulations (sims). I didn’t open up the area for a few years. After coming back, and evaluating the structure of Second Life, I realized that the new mesh design was not compatible with the _old builds.10_ Second Life’s conversion to mesh geometry occurred on August 23, 2011. ▲

**I:**

Did the gameplay limit BDSM practices that are possible IRL? What new practices did it allow for?

**S:**

Basically, you can do anything in SL that you would do in real life. At the same time, you can do a lot more in SL that you wouldn’t do in real life. One of my favorite things to do in SL is fly. When I was a child, I dreamt of flying over my city at night. Second Life brought back a little bit of my childhood dreams. One thing that is great about Second Life is that some of the sims turn on a feature that allows you to die. Unlike in real life when you die, in Second Life you just teleport home.  
  
As far as being in the lifestyle, I find that playing in Second Life as a FemDom lacks the ability to replicate the pain that can be found in real-life play. Although, Second Life sometimes allows people in their homes to experience pain through instructed self-infliction. A person who is roleplaying in Second Life could invoke a safe word to stop the activity just like in real life.  
  
As far as someone who is not in the lifestyle, has never experienced the lifestyle, and is engaging in Second Life, you would find those people dealing with a more mental humiliation. People that are not in the lifestyle in real life are prone to using Second Life to experiment. This works both ways, since I am a real-life Dom, I tend to use Second Life for nonlifestyle adventures.

**I:**

At the OWK in SL, how did members use their avatars?

**S:**

Second Life is a very versatile platform, and it caters to many different aspects of life. Avatars can engage in many levels of relationships including sexual activity. You can even go shopping in its marketplace for sexual parts. Male avatars are like Ken dolls, and you can shop for penises. When you log into Second Life, there is a plethora of avatar enhancements, including skin, hair, nails, heads, bodies, makeup, clothing, and mesh body parts. Residents of Second Life even have the ability to customize themselves to look like their real-life selves or to make something completely different to express themselves.

**I:**

Did the rules of the OWK’s founding charter still apply in the SL community? For instance, did participating women need to reach the age of consent and own at least one male slave?

**S:**

We had similar rules and hierarchies, though we had to incorporate them within Second Life’s terms of service. We also had an additional element where we added voice verification to confirm the Dominant Female’s _gender.11_ For a more complete exploration of the fraught connection between gender identity and digital verification technology, see the work of [Os Keyes](https://ironholds.org/research/). ▲ There was a Queen, but the role was switched every month as a way of democratizing the role. There were Lady Citizens, male slaves, Pony Trainers, Slave Trainers, Guardesses, and the slave secretary.

**I:**

Was there a hierarchy of players/community members that corresponded to the hierarchy in the physical OWK (Queen > Sublime Ladies > Female Citizen > Farm Animal > Male Slave)? The physical OWK also maintained its own “currency, passports, police force, courts, state flag, and state hymn,” according to Queen Patricia the First. Did any of these tools exist in the OWK in SL and/or were new ones created?

**S:**

In Second Life we used Second Life money (Linden bucks). Our passports were our digital memberships to the Second Life group. We didn’t have our own hymn, but our theme song was “Venus in Furs” by the Velvet Underground. We picked this song because there is a rumor that _Venus in Furs_, an 1870 novel by Austrian author Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, was the original inspiration for the OWK in Czech Republic. I designed a new flag for the OWK in SL because we didn't want to copy the original design. Our flag had a Guardess hat on it with a whip and read “Other World Kingdom in SL.” In the physical OWK, there was a rule where you couldn’t look at Queen Patricia the First, but that wasn’t a practice that we could reasonably reproduce the same way in cyberspace.

**I:**

The voice recordings bring up a question of gender more generally. Did the definition of male/female become more flexible in the digital OWK? Were there conversations about gender in the community?

**S:**

There was one trans woman in the Lady Senate, prior to my taking over, who was one of the Doms. She ended up leaving after there was some conflict with other (cis) women on the council who didn’t like her presence, though I supported her. She was never voice verified. In the end, prior to my taking over of the OWK in SL, we adopted the same values as the real-world OWK and only accepted \[cis women as\] Dominants. There were a number of other players who never voice verified either, but that was fine, and the male slaves knew that before interacting with them. A hierarchy of gender was the founding motivation for the OWK in SL. Though we allowed other races and species, the female-gendered role players were always above the males. This scenario kept the environment in a state where males were inherently desiring to worship and uplift women.

**I:**

Could you walk me through a typical role play that went on in the OWK in SL?

**S:**

One of the typical role plays was ponyplay. There was a Pony Trainer, and either a pony would sign up to be trained and would rent a stable, or someone who owned a pony and wanted to learn how to train their pony would rent the stable. The OWK Pony Trainer would go through all the aspects of how to train ponies, starting with showing the person what types of gear to buy in Second Life. Then, the trainer would show the owner how to train, just like a person would do it in the physical OWK pony area. This entailed showing them how to use a whip, a cart, and number commands to tell the pony what to do: one to go, two to stop, etc.

**I:**

As a real-life Dominant, what was it like dominating a male slave through Second Life?

**S:**

I was in the lifestyle before Second Life, and there was a lot of flow between online and IRL interactions. When I first entered SL, a lot of people flocked to me, and I had a group of twenty-four people before I entered _Second Life.12_ At one point up to a hundred men per day would contact Shayna to join her stable. ▲ Some of the women in Second Life started to freak out and call me names. Two of the names stuck in my head, one of them being “the vortex.” The other name I was referred to as was “the Borg.” Well, I kind of believe that when people throw stones at you, you use them as building blocks to construct your empire. So, my Second Life house in the sky resides in a Borg cube. As far as dominating males through Second Life or online, one of my most prominent adventures was with a young man from San Diego who I had met online in 2003. I micromanaged his life to the extent of putting him in college, telling him how to spend his money, and telling him when to sleep and eat. I pretty much dominated this guy’s life, and we were together daily for eight years. After he got a BS in college, he ended up moving in with us and going on to get a doctorate. To me this is real domination, not the porn you see on the net. Though we may have had the kink in our relationship through the web and in real life, it's no _Fifty Shades of Grey_. It was a real lifestyle relationship where a Dominant Female controlled a male slave. As far as dominating males online through Second Life, this was the kind of domination that normally doesn’t happen. Most of the time you had players and kinksters who were just there to get their rocks off.

The public pillory right outside the castle.

**I:**

How was the reconstruction of the OWK in SL funded? Were “male slaves” charged fees in the OWK? If money was being generated through the OWK in SL community, how was the money governed? Individually, collectively, etc.?

**S:**

You can own property in SL, and I owned the territory that the OWK was _on.13_ The real estate market and bubble in Second Life is historically insulated against, and even inversely proportional to US and global real estate crashes; the Second Life economy is currently worth approximately $500 million. ▲ Male slaves paid fees and rent to be a part of the kingdom. Most of the proceeds went to pay for the sim. It was approximately three hundred dollars a month. Any leftover donations were divided among the Lady Senate. In addition to fees, we had donations. A percentage went to the Lady Senate and to Lady Citizens. Male slaves were there to contribute and donate. We would also have dances or parties and donate the funds we raised to nonprofits and charities supporting cancer research or abused women.

**I:**

Were there specific hurdles you had to overcome in order to justify your community in SL? Did any of the OWK in SL practices butt up against user policies?

**S:**

You can basically do whatever you want, providing you stay within the guidelines of Second Life. It was not as much the institution of SL that I have had issues with but the changing culture. With FemDom you are doing it because you want to, because it has an ideology you support, not because you want money for it necessarily. You also have to think about it on a global level, in today’s world you have a lot of catfish out there scamming people out of money. This fetish has its fill of catfish just like any other genre on the internet.

**I:**

Have you heard about the OWK castle complex in the Czech Republic reopening under new ownership in 2018, after it was bought by a man who also secured the rights to Queen Patricia the First’s _title and narrative?14_ According to some women affiliated with the OWK, its current owner is a man who used the grounds as a pay-to-play set for Doms to make films and other content to sell online. The OWK website states that its current owner is still Queen Patricia the First. ▲ How do you feel about this next stage of evolution for the OWK?

**S:**

I believe that the physical OWK no longer exists on the grounds; the buildings and the castle were put up for _sale.15_ The sixteenth-century castle and surrounding complex that the OWK inhabited purportedly cost over $2 million to renovate. The money was supplied by financial backers who remain anonymous and have since sought to recoup their loss by listing the complex on a “castle only” realty site. The listing appears to be no longer active, suggesting that the property has been sold to new owners. ▲ Whatever is there now is not the old OWK as it stood. In the OWK in SL there were also issues of trademark and licensing. Myself and the group of eight women who originally founded OWK in SL received help from the physical owk.cz website. The Sublime Lady BeeQueen Smythe helped by making us diagrams of where stuff was _supposed to be.16_ This was her name in Second Life—she was a real-life Austrian dominatrix who visited the physical OWK. ▲ Once we established the buildings, we opened the sim for use. OWK was then trademarked in the USA, and we had full rights to its use in SL. As a business woman, I had other plans for the name in the future.

**I:**

Speaking of business, what is your next venture?

**S:**

The [Oracle of Women’s Knowledge](http://owkempower.com/) is an alternative initialism of “OWK.” The OWK in the United States is run by a female and was originally established to promote female empowerment and female-led relationships. It also adopted the use of aquaponics and livestock to create a self-sustaining community. The land resides in rural Tennessee. During the current COVID-19 crisis, we are working with other nonprofits to help families who are in need. We are helping them survive either the loss of their home or income, through the use of educational videos on the internet. These videos feature survival tactics if a family becomes homeless during this pandemic. The mission continues.
