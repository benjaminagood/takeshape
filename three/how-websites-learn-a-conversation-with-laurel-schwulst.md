featuredFigCaption: This is one of my Apple AirPods and a blown-up replica I
  sculpted sitting beside it. I like that my sculpture is about the size of a
  phone, and that the small AirPod can fit nicely inside the concave part of the
  large one. By making the replica, in a new way I was able to appreciate the
  design of the original AirPod.
title: "How Websites Learn: A Conversation with Laurel Schwulst"
author: Benjamin Good
---
Today’s web has a crisis of character. Perhaps it is due to an unconscious identification with what is familiar and visible; there is a sameness when flying from link to link, index to index. Laurel Schwulst is an artist and designer whose websites feel like a clearing in a dense of trees. It would be wrong to say her work is nostalgic for an earlier age—rather it adapts the processes of the early internet to a new time. There is great excitement to be found in her work’s creative reuse of web elements, recurrent signifiers, and unconventional approaches to websites-as-metaphors.

Schwulst frequently collaborates with fellow artists. In 2013 she worked with visual artist Sydney Shen on [Perfume Area](https://perfume-area.com/reviews), a website featuring poetic-prosaic reviews of fragrances. Later, over the course of 2020, she worked with fellow internet artist Elliott Cost on a podcast called [HTML Energy](https://html.energy), where they speak with other artists who use HTML in surprising ways. Schwulst is also an educator, teaching website making through her program [Fruitful School](https://fruitful.school) and as a lecturer at Yale. We sat down for a virtual interview, where I asked her about how websites age, about how we should understand web usability, about how we might use analogies between the materials of architecture and the language of web design.
