    <p>From the 1970s onward, computing technology developed rapidly. The personal computer revolutionized office spaces and the very nature of work itself. Among other things, computers replaced adding machines, typewriters, and filing cabinets—a wide variety of technologies used to create, store, and retrieve information. As computers became ubiquitous in the 1980s, they also became synonymous with information technology (IT). By the 1990s the IT sector and the internet had transformed how businesses managed the majority of such semirepetitive processes, including customer support, payroll, inventory, and much more. Services such as these that can be performed using computers are known as “IT-enabled services.”</p>
<hr>
<p>The United States was no stranger to the concept of outsourcing, a business model in which companies source goods or services externally, often from cheaper offshore labor forces. US companies first adopted outsourcing with the advent of the railroad; later outsourcing led to a decline of the US manufacturing industry. By subcontracting out parts of their manufacturing processes to offshore locations, US companies were able to cut costs and increase their profit margins. IT-enabled services could easily be outsourced—call centers could be set up halfway across the world and operated for a fraction of the cost of their domestic counterparts.</p>
<p>By the 1990s <em>outsourcing</em> was a mainstream buzzword. Today the trope of a call-center employee with an Indian accent is commonplace in pop culture. But how did India become the default destination for the IT outsourcing industry? The conditions were created in part by economic and cultural colonialism, paired with India’s access to English-language education and science studies. India had already invested in science and engineering as part of its nation-building project. For example, the first Indian Institute of Technology, modeled on MIT, was founded in 1950. By the 90s India was experiencing a tech boom, and the country had a large workforce of bilingual, specialized employees. Finally, after decades of being a closed economy, India liberalized its economic policies in 1991, making it a lucrative destination for foreign investment.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/indranil3.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Over the past three decades, cities like Bangalore and Gurgaon, with clusters of outsourcing companies, became known as tech hubs. The industry has been a major contributor to India’s economy—one journalist <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/07/indian-call-center-americanization/">characterized</a> the millions of calls made and received by Indian call centers as “one of the largest intercultural exchanges in history.” A less optimistic 2001 study, however, <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/203549187">referred to call centers</a> and other outsourced services as “digital sweatshops.” The provocative comparison isn’t without merit, as employees have little to no recourse against harsh working conditions. According to the study, the average wage for Indian software engineers at the time was between $4,000 and $23,000 per year, a much lower salary than what their US counterparts typically received. In his book about call-center workers, sociologist Shehzad Nadeem describes a dystopian setting that involves inhumane hours, accent neutralization training, and rampant surveillance of employees.</p>
<p>The outsourcing evangelist Peter Drucker popularized the phrase “sell the mailroom.” If companies could stop wasting time and money on logistical operations, the argument went, they could focus more on innovation and increase profits. But US companies soon found that it was profitable to outsource more than just the mailroom. Call-center contractors represented some of the most vulnerable workers indirectly employed by US companies. They were easily replaceable because they didn’t provide specialized skills beyond the ability to speak English. But gradually another kind of outsourcing was on the rise—one that involved technical abilities like software programming.</p>
<p>In the 1990s the IT industry was growing fast in the United States. The impending problem of the Y2K bug created an increasing demand for IT labor. US tech companies lobbied to increase the number of H-1B recipients, citing the need for more skilled workers. (Many workers, on the other hand, argued that the problem wasn’t a lack of skilled labor, but the fact that companies wanted to avoid paying fairly for it.) As US companies became more dependent on external labor, offshore outsourcing companies popped up. They worked with US corporations to find foreign workers and assist them in securing temporary visas to work in the United States. These relationships soon incentivized outsourcing companies to establish onshore operations in the United States.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/indranil4.svg" alt="interior of office with hexagonal cubicles."></p>
<p>The H-1B visa was introduced in 1990 to help US companies address what they claimed were labor shortages in rapidly growing industries that required specialized skills. In the following years, the IT outsourcing industry became the biggest beneficiary of the program.</p>
<hr>
<p>The H-1B has its origins in the H1 visa, which was introduced as part of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The H1 visa was intended for immigrants “of distinguished merit and ability” who would temporarily move to the United States to perform specialized labor. The 1952 act abolished racial restrictions on immigration and naturalization. However, it continued to use the National Origins Formula, which mandated racist and xenophobic national-origin-based quotas that favored countries seen as “desirable” by the US. Immigrants from Asia, who until then were considered ineligible for naturalization, were given small quotas.</p>
<p>The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 went a step further, abolishing the National Origins Formula. When signing the act into law, President Lyndon B. Johnson said, “This system violates the basic principle of American democracy—the principle that values and rewards each man on the basis of his merit as a man. It has been un-American in the highest sense, because it has been untrue to the faith that brought thousands to these shores even before we were a country.”</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/indranil5.svg" alt="two lines of people, each line moving into different doorways."></p>
<p>This marked a radical shift in US immigration policy, which until then had largely focused on restricting the immigration and naturalization of nonwhite people. US policy now tacitly placed an emphasis on the “good immigrant,” a mythical figure who is only as valuable as their technical skills and employability. On paper immigrants may be free to chase the American Dream, but in reality they are hindered by a legalized system of exploitation.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 1990 the H1 visa was split into two categories—H-1A for nurses, and H-1B for workers in specialty occupations. A cap was introduced, limiting the number of H-1B visas issued each year to 65,000 people. As the number of applications could exceed the cap, the United States introduced a controversial lottery system to allot visas in 2005. IT outsourcing firms capitalize on this lottery system to secure an overwhelming majority of the H-1B visas issued each year.</p>
<p>Applying for an H-1B visa is a complicated and expensive process. Small companies can have their resources stretched thin while going through the process. In contrast, some of the top outsourcing firms are huge multinational companies worth billions of dollars. Since there is no limit to the number of petitions a company may submit, about a dozen outsourcing firms inundate the lottery with thousands of applications. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/06/us/outsourcing-companies-dominate-h1b-visas.html">2015 <em>New York Times</em> report</a> found that just seven outsourcing firms based in India had secured nearly 20 percent of the total H-1B visas the previous year. The effect has been profound—since the mid-1990s, hundreds of thousands of Indian tech workers have immigrated to the United States. This has established one of the largest patterns of labor migration in recent history. According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services data, over 70 percent of the H-1B visas granted in 2019 were provided to Indians, and this trend holds true for previous years as well.</p>
<p>The H-1B is purportedly a mechanism to bring “the best and the brightest” to the United States, not to create an underclass of lower-paid tech workers with fewer labor protections. A direct employer like Microsoft pays some of their H-1B employees wages that can be reasonably compared to similarly employed US citizens. By contrast, an outsourcing company like Tata Consultancy Services pays their H-1B employees much less than similarly employed US citizens. Critics have been raising the alarm about this phenomenon for years; they argue that the program allows companies to legally underpay H-1B workers. In fact, in an analysis published earlier this year, researchers Daniel Costa and Ron Hira <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/h-1b-visas-and-prevailing-wage-levels/">found</a> that 60 percent of H-1B workers are paid below median wage for their jobs.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/indranil6.svg" alt="drawing of monster."></p>
<p>Even if a company directly employs “high-skilled” H-1B workers at a fair wage, that doesn’t stop them from outsourcing “low-skilled” parts of their business processes—and which parts fall into which category is constantly being redefined by businesses. In 2010 Infosys received a three-year contract for all of Microsoft’s internal IT help desk operations. After facing concerns, Microsoft emphasized that this wouldn’t threaten the jobs of its existing employees. In a more revealing statement, then–Infosys Vice President Anand Natraj said, “We will get the first opportunities to build competencies in newer Microsoft technologies.” Whether tech giants admit it or not, their operations don’t just rely on the highest-paid programming employees. They also contract out work to the lower-paid H1-B employees of outsourcing companies. This is to say nothing of the various other more marginal workers that tech companies employ, from contingent delivery gig workers to operational staff like cooks and janitors, none of whom are on H-1B visas. It’s ironic that the technology industry, which is always predicting the disappearance of jobs, is so heavily dependent on physical labor.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many elected officials agree to at least some version of the following: the United States shouldn’t turn away high-skilled foreign workers; foreign workers shouldn’t be used to replace US workers; and outsourcing companies shouldn’t be allowed to game the visa process. Politicians often make the argument that companies exploit loopholes in the law to abuse the H-1B program, but it can be difficult to determine precisely what these loopholes are. There are a couple of contenders.</p>
<p>Every petition for an H-1B visa must include a Labor Condition Application (LCA) from the employer. The LCA enforces many of the checks and balances of the program, including the mandate that foreign workers must be paid industry-standard wages. However, with little oversight, employers determine what the prevailing wages are. This makes it quite difficult for the government to challenge the accuracy of these numbers.</p>
<p>If the number of H-1B employees in a company crosses a defined threshold, the employer is designated an “H-1B dependent employer.” The company is then required to file additional paperwork to prove, among other things, that it is not replacing US workers. However, if a prospective visa holder is paid a minimum of $60,000 per year or has a master’s degree (or higher) in the field, the employer doesn’t have to prove it made an effort to recruit US workers, nor show that it is not displacing them. Built into the H-1B laws are provisions that undercut the fundamental requirements companies are expected to abide by when hiring foreign workers. These loopholes have been the basis of how the law has operated for the last two decades. In practical terms, they appear less like loopholes and more like the very reason the H-1B exists.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is not a story about bureaucracy, nor about the impenetrable complexity of US immigration laws. This is a story about human lives. US immigration policies treat human lives as pawns, while allowing corporations to relocate operations and workers across borders whenever it becomes profitable. The same systems socialize us into having a narrow idea of merit, defined by our ability to generate wealth. And when we pursue this ideal, all but a few are punished.</p>
<p>Extreme cases of H-1B abuse occur at so-called “body shops,” which act as brokers, supplying short-term foreign labor to companies primarily for IT-related services. Like outsourcing firms, but even more profit driven, body shops subject their workers to harsh abuse, practically holding them in servitude. They withhold millions of dollars in wages and file lawsuits against employees who quit. It’s worth pointing out that the line between a legitimate outsourcing operation and a body shop can be blurry. In one of the most perverse manifestations of late capitalism, some body-shop owners are themselves Indian, and seek out vulnerable Indian H-1B workers to exploit on US soil.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/indranil7.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>The patterns of abuse are remarkably similar to those experienced by H-2A visa holders, temporary agricultural workers in the United States. A recent NBC investigation <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/h2a-visa-program-for-farmworkers-surging-under-trump-and-labor-violations/">uncovered</a> an increase in H-2A abuse; workers, most of whom are Mexican, endured unlivable housing conditions and were not paid. Once again, those worst affected were recruited by labor brokers. Significantly, when Trump announced his visa restrictions because of COVID-19, H-2A workers were exempt because they were deemed essential by the agricultural lobby.</p>
<p>The use of H-1B as a source of cheap labor is a direct result of US policies; for years, US companies have profited from cheap foreign labor. Now that the presence of the people who do that labor has become politically inconvenient, everyone is scrambling for solutions. The plight of these workers isn’t exactly the US government’s priority. At any time, changes in immigration laws can turn the lives of H-1B workers and their families upside down. This is the reality lived by tens of thousands of people in the United States. A recent <em>Mother Jones</em> investigation into the Trump administration’s handling of H-1B cases <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/12/trump-h1b-visa-immigration-restrictions/">revealed</a> that there has been a huge spike in denials for what would otherwise be routine visa renewals. None of the H-1B’s structural problems are being addressed, and these arbitrary denials are in line with Trump’s racist immigration policies. Such policies pit marginalized groups against one another to the advantage of the ruling class. While some “high-skilled” workers villainize the employees of outsourcing companies for adversely affecting their prospects, the truth is that “low-skilled” workers aren’t to blame. It is the US government, and corporations, that have created the current situation.</p>
<p>Harsh immigration policies create an underclass of workers who can’t speak up about poor working conditions for fear of being deported. “Low-skilled” immigrant workers are targeted by everyone, becoming scapegoats for all problems with US immigration policy. Right-wing outlets like the Center for Immigration Studies have used the H-1B issue to further their anti-immigration agenda without questioning how we got here. It’s not impossible to expand protection for both local and foreign workers, but it will be at the cost of lost profits for technology companies. Is that something their lobbyists will allow?</p>
<hr>
<p>If we focus on skill level as the issue that fixes the H-1B, we will miss the point about why the program has been so valuable to the United States. The idea that enforcing H-1B regulations will drastically improve job prospects for US workers is a stretch.</p>
<p>Cheap labor is the primary reason outsourcing is profitable. This is why it’s useful to see the establishment of the H-1B in 1990 within the context of the IT outsourcing industry, which was growing at the exact same time. A cynical but feasible interpretation of the program is that it was introduced with the very goal of giving US companies access to cheap IT labor. From this perspective, the program has functioned exactly as it was designed to.</p>
<p>The role of technological development is overestimated in the success of Western industry. Or rather, the role of exploitation—of natural resources and human lives in countries in the Global South—is ignored. If companies are willing to go to such lengths to hire cheaper foreign labor, they will not jump to hire expensive US workers if this access dries up. Instead, they will likely offshore the work back to India; the infrastructure there is already set up.</p>
<p>Any model of the future that overestimates the role of technology in disrupting the status quo is reductive. International borders and the strength of passports has as much to do with how we’ll live and work in the future as disruptive technologies. As pundits predict the ways in which artificially intelligent automation will revolutionize the future of work, it’s useful to pay attention to how cheap, invisible labor continues to be a shorthand for automation.</p>
