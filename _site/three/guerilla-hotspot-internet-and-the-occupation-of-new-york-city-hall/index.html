    <p>In late June a group of activists took up residence at New York’s City Hall Park. In the following days their numbers grew into the hundreds, and their demonstration attracted national attention. I joined the encampment on the second day and ended up staying for eight more. After protesting daily for nearly a month, I was excited to see an escalation of tactics and a specific, time-sensitive demand: to defund the NYPD by at least $1 billion in the city’s upcoming budget. Ultimately, our demands were answered in name only, but the reverberations of the broader movement will no doubt have impacts for years to come.</p>
<p>One of the stated goals of the City Hall protest was to draw a connection between the overpolicing of homeless New Yorkers and the broader racial justice movement. The protest was led by Vocal-NY, a nonprofit focused specifically on this intersection. Much of the language and action at City Hall centered around serving and celebrating everyone in the space. Food, shelter, and community were available to all, from housed New Yorkers passing through, to unhoused residents already living in the area. In addition to providing general support, I arrived at the space with the goal of adding internet access as a shared resource for the encampment. As a volunteer organizer with the nonprofit NYC Mesh, I have been building a community-owned, community-operated network in the city for several years. NYC Mesh’s focus on democratized internet infrastructure shares much with the broader movement’s emphasis on mutual aid and collectively rethinking public services through a racial justice and restorative justice lens.</p>
<p>In the United States, the connections between policing of Black communities and policing to protect capitalist interests run deep. The first public police force in the country protected commercial assets in Boston, and in the South, police were first introduced in the form of slave patrols, an institution explicitly intended to enforce racial hierarchy. Police forces in both cases patrolled public spaces. In the two decades since the 9/11 attacks, the policing of public space has moved into the digital realm as well. The NYPD now commands a vast network of surveillance cameras and has been known to employ “Stingrays” at anti-police protests—devices that record uniquely identifying information from all phones nearby. Additionally, New York is now home to two large surveillance-funded “free” Wi-Fi networks. In the context of racialized poverty, this means that nonwhite New Yorkers are disproportionately forced into nonconsensual surveillance to access resources that their white counterparts already enjoy. The question of who is tolerated in public space remains as much of an issue today as it was over a century ago.</p>
<p>In the modern-day United States, the hostility of public space is nowhere more evident than in Midtown and Lower Manhattan. Locals and tourists alike contend with lack of public restrooms, uninviting places to sit, and expensive food options. This is not merely the result of a simple accident or market pressure. Public policy keeps these places privatized. New York’s first land-use regulations in 1913 were explicitly designed, according to urban planner George McAneny, to prevent “unwholesome and dangerous” congestion of these very streets, keeping unseemly garment factories and their workers separate from new, pristine shopping districts like those on Fifth Avenue. A century later, real estate’s influence has only grown more powerful. Gentrified districts are designed from the ground up to accommodate wealth and consumption at the expense of nearly everything and everyone else.</p>
<p>When the zoning of these districts cannot sufficiently control behavior, other methods are used. Police and private security enforce anti-loitering laws, nightly park closures, and free speech restrictions, sometimes confining protest activity to designated “free speech zones.” Digital parallels exist too. Using free Wi-Fi often requires viewing advertisements or enduring time limits. A limited supply of public power outlets encourages casual, short-term use of resources but makes extended use frustrating and difficult. Omnipresent security cameras help with the prosecution of crimes, but they can also serve as a social deterrent, reminding those nearby to be on their best behavior. Even new “pedestrianized zones” and privately managed public plazas strategically deploy bumps and spikes on benches to discourage unhoused people from sleeping on them. While modern redesigns add convenience and beauty to the experiences of office workers, shoppers, and wealthier tourists, everyone behaving outside of the prescribed vision is left uncomfortable at best. At worst, they are threatened with surveillance and subjected to outright police violence. An objection to this theory of policing and space hierarchy has been a centerpiece of recent Black Lives Matter protests.</p>
<p>While functioning public Wi-Fi may not seem as important as functioning public space, the need for it is now clearer than ever. Sometime in the past two decades the internet has moved from a luxury “want” to an essential “need” for nearly everyone in our society. Since long before the pandemic, accessing banking, healthcare, and housing has been nearly impossible without email and a web browser. This harsh reality has kept many impoverished New Yorkers from accessing these resources at all. With the onset of COVID-19, the digital divide has only become more ruthless, leaving those without access at a severe disadvantage to work, apply for unemployment assistance, or access education. For those without regular access to a home with private Wi-Fi, the nature of publicly accessible Wi-Fi is hauntingly similar to that of other needs, like bathrooms, that are barely met in our current public sphere. Two major providers of free Wi-Fi in New York, Transit Wireless and Google-affiliate LinkNYC, have business models explicitly based on advertising and selling hyperlocal user data collected through their hotspots. While they claim to be providing a community-oriented service, these companies are projected to take in millions of dollars annually from these ventures.</p>
<p>Even the current model of private internet provision has trended heavily toward censorship and surveillance. Cellular companies routinely sell customer location data, and the repeal of net neutrality laws in late 2017 has already had measurable effects on the quality of video-streaming service from Netflix, Skype, and YouTube. The Black Lives Matter movement has been fueled by videos of police violence that have spread quickly across the globe on social media platforms. Livestreaming is crucial to this phenomenon—law enforcement often seizes phones from those arrested, making after-the-fact video evidence a risky proposition. Many of the protests themselves have been coordinated through social media too. Thus far social media companies have allowed the movement to flourish online, but there’s little stopping them from restricting this content in the future, or simply prioritizing other traffic.</p>

<p>By “occupying” a downtown public plaza as a form of protest, activists at City Hall highlighted the fact that “atypical” use of public space and resources has become criminalized, and that this criminalization has a disparate racial and economic impact. The form that the protest took helped to demonstrate that a different world was possible. Taking up residence in the park was about more than finding a suitable place to eat and sleep—it was about asserting the right to rethink and rebuild public space outside of the realm of policing and profit. Protesters tested the limits of this new space, creating systems to care for each other and provide for collective needs. Elaborate home-grown systems were quickly developed to provide protesters with food, shelter, bathrooms, and medical care. Soon other needs began to be met, including art making, community meditation, and a free library. Within a few days, a community Wi-Fi network was established as well.</p>
<p>Much like the protest itself, the community internet was more than a spontaneous creation. The Wi-Fi network was initiated and built at City Hall Park by members of NYC Mesh, which since 2012 has been building a decentralized, community-owned network that now serves several thousand people. Members share connections with each other using specially configured equipment mounted on their rooftops and windows. The entirely volunteer-run organization helps install hardware for new members and develops technology standards that have allowed the network to double in size year after year without too many growing pains.</p>
<p>The network is primarily concentrated in residential neighborhoods within Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. Most members connect from the roofs of their small and medium-sized apartment buildings to one of six larger “hubs” on top of taller residential and commercial buildings. These hubs are linked to one of two “supernodes” where NYC Mesh connects with the wider internet. Unlike hubs or small residential buildings, these supernodes can only be located in a few very specific buildings, buildings where there is an internet exchange point where internet providers’ infrastructure interconnects. In a twist of fate, NYC Mesh’s first and most prominent supernode, known as “SN1,” is located about 1,400 feet from the protest site at City Hall.</p>
<p>The fact that this hub of internet infrastructure is located in close proximity to New York’s center of government power isn’t a grand conspiracy, but it isn’t an accident either. The City Hall area has been New York’s locus of government and technology for centuries. Thomas Edison’s first electrical distribution network was laid just to the southeast, and the Brooklyn Bridge touches down across the street. The now-abandoned City Hall station of New York’s first subway line sits directly beneath City Hall Park. Government and commercial interests have crucial phone and internet infrastructure located near them. Geographically concentrated technological infrastructure has been a powerful, if subtle, force.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, being close to a supernode does not guarantee an easy connection to the mesh. SN1’s location, near New York’s government and financial center, leaves it far from the residential areas that NYC Mesh typically serves. The infrastructure atop the building is geared toward extending the network to further-flung neighborhoods north and east of the supernode but not those to the south and west. These nearby areas are much less conducive to community internet as they are commercial districts, so there are fewer opportunities for a tenant to put a DIY internet antenna on the roof. This meant that the protest Wi-Fi installation would have to connect through a different nearby building instead.</p>
<p>One of two west-facing antennae on SN1 provides a point-to-point connection to the municipal office building across the street from City Hall. A local politician, Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, has hosted a node in this building for over a year, but at the time of the protest, the equipment had been turned off. Getting this node turned back on took several days of coordination as the office building was technically closed due to the pandemic. However, once the office building’s node was back up, Wi-Fi at the protest site was a fairly simple extension of the office’s connection.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi was heavily used almost immediately. Over the next week, at least several hundred devices connected. Phones and tablets represent one-time costs and are fairly ubiquitous even among the poorest New Yorkers. But the recurring cost of monthly data plans is prohibitive for many. For the protesters without such data plans, the Wi-Fi was much more than a luxury—it provided a communication lifeline. It was also important for organizers, making it possible for them to conduct their work on laptops rather than small, keyboardless phones. This helped them to type long messages, navigate complex spreadsheets, and send large files as they kept the occupation running smoothly and coordinated with the outside world. By the time the protest ended, Wi-Fi users had uploaded almost as much data as they had downloaded. This is highly unusual and not something present in any other part of the NYC Mesh network—normally, internet users download far more than they upload. This anomaly was likely due to protesters’ extensive livestreaming of police–protester interactions—a tactic that has become increasingly common in order to prevent police from destroying video evidence held on phones.</p>
<p>While the high upload-to-download ratio at City Hall may seem like a quirky afterthought, it’s illustrative of the generative nature of the current protest movement. The temporary world built in Lower Manhattan by the protesters was one full of art and ideas, sharing and creation. The network infrastructure to support such a movement requires a fundamentally different kind of internet than what most people have today. Commercial Wi-Fi, like modern public space, is geared toward consumption. Most residential internet providers tweak their equipment to provide fast download speeds at the expense of nearly all upload capacity. This version of the internet is tailored to be used exclusively for browsing Facebook and binging Netflix. Those who create and share content are faced with relatively slow upload speeds on even the fastest and most modern connections. Just as public space can discourage behaviors like sleeping outside and marching in protests, the physical fabric of the internet can make creation and information sharing less welcome.</p>
<p>For low-income New Yorkers, protesters, and community network builders, Lower Manhattan can be a hostile place. And yet this seat of political, financial, and technological power remains central to those passionate about rethinking our world. At first glance, open Wi-Fi may not seem as important as shelter, food, or bathrooms—needs that have always been universal. Yet in its relative infancy, the internet has become an essential component of participation in society. Who does and does not have access to the tools of information, coordination, and amplification determines who will have power and stake in our society going forward. A privately controlled, surveillance-funded network leaves us with worrying implications for our future; but an open, collectively-run alternative could help everyone freely access public space—both online and off.</p>
