    <p>High-speed internet is an essential part of daily life, a reality made painfully noticeable by the current coronavirus pandemic. Yet millions of Americans still have inadequate access to this technology. This diagram shows how the funding and deployment of the internet’s physical infrastructure is largely dependent on the federal government’s ever-changing definition of who qualifies as “unserved” and “underserved” by broadband internet access. Over the last two decades, there have been disagreements over the way broadband is mapped and classified. Competing partisan interests are invested in positioning broadband as either a public utility or a private amenity, and as either a “telecommunications service” or an “information service.”</p>
<p>Our digital and political systems are complexly intertwined, and the physical “stuff” of the internet—the placement of fiber-optic cables, servers, and routers—is ultimately governed by bureaucratic interests. When politicians emphasize geography and population density to describe network deficiencies, the government focuses on helping private companies expand their broadband infrastructure to unserved rural areas, places where people have little or no internet access. However, this also shifts focus away from historically excluded urban areas, disregarding the needs of underserved low-income residents who may have few affordable internet options at their disposal. While the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) aims to increase Americans’ access to broadband, this diagram reveals conflicts between governing bodies over who is more deserving of this technology, further exacerbating the rural–urban divide that characterizes the nation’s current political landscape.</p>
