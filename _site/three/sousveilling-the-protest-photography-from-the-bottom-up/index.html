    <section class="content">
    <p>On the last weekend of May 2020 thousands of New Yorkers marched in several neighborhoods, protesting yet another act of anti-Black police violence. Earlier that week, a cell-phone-recorded video of George Floyd’s murder spread on the internet and cable news. Suddenly the street returned as a space of physical meeting, this time carrying an unfamiliar, nervous energy. Protesters passed hand sanitizer between chants; New York had not seen such a large public gathering since it was announced as the pandemic’s epicenter, a landscape of makeshift outdoor hospitals and portable morgues.</p>
<p>At a protest I attended in Harlem on Saturday, May 30 everyone recorded everything. It seemed natural to capture an uprising in the midst of a global lockdown, to display participation and to encourage more. And given that a cell phone delivered the original call to action, it made sense to wield our devices as weapons against the police. I turned on my camera when NYPD officers arrested a young Black woman, who silently stood in front of them with her right fist raised. I recorded when a cloud of pepper spray blocked our route downtown, and we turned around hoping to find another path. That weekend, dozens of videos depicting the NYPD went viral on Twitter. One video showed an NYPD officer pushing a woman to the ground. Others showed NYPD vans on fire or driving into protesters. By Monday, June 1, the mayor had set a curfew on the city.</p>
<p>I continued attending protests throughout June. I learned about them through Instagram and sent DMs of the flyers to friends. Though each protest felt distinct, iPhones dotted every crowd, speakers always gave statements, and white people regularly held signs saying “fuck white supremacy” and “silence is violence.” Cameras were pointed at my masked face; cameras were pointed at the cops’ unmasked faces. Each time a cop grabbed a protester, cameras rushed forward, bringing proof of the abuse into the hands of dozens. Yet once the photo or video was presumably posted on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, it could ultimately be in the hands of thousands, if not millions. Helicopters and drones buzzed above, while some protesters kneeled or marched. I went to a forty-person vigil for Black Trans Lives with a police drone watching, and cops dotting the perimeter. Keenly aware of all the eyes circling, I posed for the future, hoping in the short term that our cell phone videos would usher in “accountability,” and that in the long term, future generations would look back at our actions with admiration. Didn’t we want to be seen?</p>
<p>As thousands continued to take to the streets throughout early June, local and federal law enforcement agencies collaborated to compile information about the protests. Months later in August, dozens of NYPD officers, some armed in tactical gear, stormed the apartment building of an organizer for Black lives. On June 1, the FBI sent out a request to civilians for information, including visual evidence, of “individuals inciting violence.” The agency defended its chilling appeal in the request itself, writing that its “mission of protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution” was “not contradictory.” The FBI nonetheless added that it was “committed to apprehending and charging violent instigators who are exploiting legitimate, peaceful protests and engaging in violations of federal law.”</p>
<p>In addition to asking for images, the FBI tracks cell-phone locations and collects data from social media, efforts intensified during the George Floyd protests with the help of private technology companies. <em>The Intercept</em> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/06/24/fbi-surveillance-social-media-cellphone-dataminr-venntel/">reported</a> that on June 9, the FBI signed an expedited agreement with Dataminr, an artificial intelligence company that provides real-time alerts from social media monitoring. Emails revealed that Dataminr relayed locations of the George Floyd protests to the Minneapolis Police Department, largely relying not on reporters, but on “ordinary bystanders—what the [Dataminr] system calls ‘eyewitnesses’—who were either watching or attending the rallies and tweeting in a completely personal capacity.” The recent moves toward expanded surveillance build on the federal monitoring of Black Lives Matter since its entrance to the national stage. With facial recognition technologies operated by both the FBI and local police departments, social media images have increasingly become vehicles for tracking individuals.</p>
<hr>
<p>Images of protest remain seductive. While protesters and organizers often know about police surveillance of social media to some degree, images continue to be useful in galvanizing support and launching emotive calls to action. Images can document, countering an authority’s rendering of a moment of conflict, and they can also construct a new reality by making solidarity visible. But how can we picture protest under a constant specter of surveillance? What happens when the state and the protester see the same image?</p>
<p>Scholars have offered insight into the question of who sees, and the power that seeing gives. In his 2011 book, <em>The Right to Look</em>, Nicholas Mirzoeff theorizes what he calls “countervisuality.” This countervisuality conflicts with an authoritative visuality, which reinforces existing power structures, and in turn renders these structures invisible. For Mirzoeff, countervisuality is more than a return of the gaze, but rather an alternative mode of viewing that encourages spectators to notice and rebel against the dominant forces that structure visual order. Not everyone has the right to look, and looking in itself—such as “reckless eyeballing” in the Jim Crow South—can be policed, strengthening the authority of visuality. Mirzoeff argues that countervisuality can be found, for example, in certain art produced in response to the anti-colonial Algerian War of Independence. In depicting the violence of imperialist visuality, Gillo Pontecorvo’s 1996 neorealist film <em>The Battle of Algiers</em> alerts the spectator to an aestheticized segregation built on the violence of a colonial order.</p>
<p>Like Mirzoeff, sociologist Simone Browne looks to the system of US slavery to think through ways of seeing. In contrast with surveillance, she draws on Steve Mann’s concept of “sousveillance,” or the “observing and recording by an entity not in a position of power or authority over the subject of the veillance.” Browne argues that a specific form of “dark sousveillance” has always accompanied the surveillance of Black bodies, which opposes such surveillance and imagines alternatives. But Browne also warns that even in attempts to watch the watcher, sousveillance can be repurposed as a surveillance tool. Video clips of uprisings and attempts to turn the camera onto the police can still amount to the “governing of black life” when uploaded to sites like Twitter and Facebook, which she likens to state-adjacent agencies. Even <em>The Battle of Algiers</em>, made before the advent of social media, has been recontextualized to support state motives: in the early days of the Iraq War, the Pentagon <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/06/24/fbi-surveillance-social-media-cellphone-dataminr-venntel/">organized</a> a screening of the film so that American soldiers could learn about guerrilla tactics in counterinsurgency and the “challenges faced by the French.”</p>
<p>For some, this possibility for state co-optation—even of visual evidence originally intended to support anti-state positioning—ultimately means that cameras always serve as tools of the state. “In Defense of Smashing Cameras,” an anonymous April 2016 contribution to <em>Anarchist News</em>, offers this sobering message: “We are making ourselves vulnerable to attack.” The piece continues, “Cameras are tools of the surveillance state and dominant forms of control that our very presence on the streets seeks to dismantle.” Echoing Browne’s warning, the post argues that the camera of the protester is the camera of the cop:</p>
<p>For every police photograph, there are ten more incriminating ones on twitter [<em>sic</em>]. For every official observation, every surveillance camera pointed our direction, we are doing ourselves the injustice of allowing ourselves to be recorded, disseminated and documented by our peers, in the name of free speech or journalistic impartiality, entitlement, whatever you want to call it. And it has to stop.</p>
<p>For me, the article also raises the questions: Who is a participant? Does holding a camera make you participate for the future, rather than the present? Photographs can document the past for the future. The idea that photography in itself can bring justice, and can therefore be superior to live participation, suggests a belief in the system to change through the act of documentation. Yet photographs and videos have failed so far at causing systemic change, or even to bringing forward the arrests of police officers. “Eyes without bodies do not move, but they may propel enemies,” the <em>Anarchist News</em> post says. A camera disrupts one’s physical presence, and to contend with this disruption, photographers must consider if their action serves justice in the present or in an assumed—perhaps fictional—future. According to the <em>Anarchist News</em> author, <em>activist</em> cannot be synonymous with <em>photographer</em>.</p>
<p>Even if organizers ban cameras or individual protesters refuse to use them, protests are ultimately public events that are seen. Cameras float among the crowd, and even among bystanders peering from balconies and windows, intrigued by the events below. Protests negotiate public space with embodied presence, physically constrained by the boundaries formed by buildings, rivers, bridges, and fences. Yet on the internet, where images of protests are shared and reshared, these physical constraints do not exist. On the ground, organizers can exercise <em>some</em> control over where a protest moves and how it behaves, yet they have almost no say over what happens in the parallel, coexisting world of social media. Protesters have rarely been able to control the gaze of the traditional news media, but in cyberspace, there is even less control, a more rapid transmission between the eyes of the protester and the eyes of the state.</p>
<hr>
<p>Are there alternative visions of protest situated in the present? Or must we give up cameras entirely? Artists reimagining protest photography in the age of facial recognition and location monitoring ultimately manipulate the act of seeing. They often turn the camera back onto the state or alert the viewer to their own participation in surveillance systems.</p>
<p>Photojournalism showing protests can be reactive, even in attempts to dispel mythologies of violent protesters and riots. Even when protesters are shown engaging in “peaceful” activities, photojournalists fall into the trap of capturing innocence. They enter the dialogue in a defensive posture. Photographs of New York’s protests in June <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/nyregion/police-kettling-protests-nyc.html/">published in the <em>New York Times</em></a>, for example, show multiple cases of protesters kneeling with their hands up, defending themselves from police officers using aggressive tactics like kettling. These images of righteous behavior, nonetheless met by brutal assault, can be contrasted with <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/01/nyc-looters-clash-with-protesters-as-another-night-of-chaos-erupts/">images</a> of “violent looting” and “illegal behavior” in the same city during the same wave of protests.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/bhaumik-2.png" alt="grey-greenish collage of mesh and ropes"></p>
<p>Surveillance scholar Torin Monahan attempts to describe surveillance art by asking:</p>
<p>In what ways can artistic endeavors alter people’s perspectives of surveillance? What is the capacity of art to reveal systems of control and induce reflexivity in others, perhaps leading them to recognize their role in surveillance systems and modify their behavior?</p>
<p>Monahan places surveillance art into several categories, including works that “emphasize viewers’ complicity or participation in the regimes in question.” This form of participatory artwork allows artists and photographers to imagine new ways of interacting with protesters. Much of what is now described as surveillance art emerged in the wake of 9/11, following the passage of the Patriot Act and the heightening state surveillance of Muslim, Middle Eastern, and South Asian communities. Hasan Elahi turns the FBI surveillance he experienced into art, Josh Begley pieces together NYPD documentation of Muslim-owned gathering places, and Mariam Ghani and Chitra Ganesh present a “warm database” of the immigrants who were detained on suspicion of terrorism after 9/11. These works unveil the hidden surveillance around us, often refashioning governmental documentation and security footage into a critique against the state itself. These artists show how the lens can be turned against powerful interests, a lesson for anyone who documents protests.</p>
<p>Many artists have hidden the identities of individual subjects captured. For instance, in Ghani and Ganesh’s work, the database of state documents is linked to anonymous, yet personal, narratives that remind us of the individual tracked by the state. But protest photography has a distinct set of tasks and uses a distinct set of subjects. Can protest photography do the work of Mirzoeff’s “countervisuality” to expose hegemonies, to capture the power of a movement, <em>and</em> to evade state surveillance? Or does the ubiquity of protest photography emerge from the very tools of social media that reinforce policing? For some, photographing protests, even in a participatory way, pauses the attack.</p>
<p>Activestills, a photography collective that operates between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, advocates for the title “activist photographer,” a positioning that differs from that of the <em>Anarchist News</em> contributor. The collective’s aims suggest that photographers can be both observers and participants. The group maintains an online archive that it describes as “operative, and not simply contemplative,” and it also puts on guerrilla exhibitions in outdoor areas where protests have taken place. Activestills’s photography has been reproduced, materially reengaging with the act of protest. In one example, Activestills took a photograph of a Palestinian activist who was later killed by an Israeli soldier. The photo was placed on shields used in later protests, and an Activestills photographer then captured photos of these shields. The shield is at once a weapon and a memory. In a photograph, the Droste effect of a protest within a protest symbolizes chronology, forward-moving time, and the constant repetition of oppression.</p>
<p>On the surface, Activestills’s work is aesthetically similar to traditional photojournalistic forms. Identities are shown, images go unmanipulated, and photographers’ actions at the scene remain interrupted by the camera’s role in documentation. But the images can reenter the protest, in posters and shields and memorials. With its embedded participation in the movement, Activestills differs from photojournalists who claim to be objective. But can the viewer notice the difference between “activist photograph” and more defensive, sensationalized photojournalism? In Activestills’s context, the final image often falls into both categories, depicting Palestinians dominated by the oppressive presence of lighter-skinned soldiers in military gear. With the lack of image manipulation, identities can potentially be traced using facial recognition technologies. While many photojournalists oppose image manipulation, it’s still unclear if the practice of erasing recognizable features alters the essential truth of an image of protest.</p>
<p>Nate Lewis is a New York–based artist and a former ICU nurse. He manipulates his protest photographs, unlike Activestills or traditional photojournalists. He writes on his website, “By altering photographs, I aim to challenge people’s perspectives on race and history through distortion and illusion.” His works often focus on bodies, distorting them with almost collage-like effects, extenuating their textures with more textures, elevating their mobility, and crafting them into dynamic forms. He takes a black-and-white image of protesters, and he obscures their faces and the protest signs they hold with scattered dots and other textures. Lewis erases identities and even the causes of protest. In one work, he fills in the windows of a building towering over protesters, and there’s no one watching them in this view. In the center of the image is an obscured, distorted, illegible protest sign, held up with a wooden stick. Perhaps it doesn’t matter that the words are illegible, or that we learn little about context from these images. The photographs reject the truth claims of traditional photojournalism, but they still manage to portray the energy of a crowd gathering for a cause.</p>
<p>Responding to the saturation of protest images in media, some artists have chosen to forgo photography when visualizing protest, instead moving to other acts of intervention. During Colombia’s national protests in 2019, Bogotá-based artist Liliana Merizalde created over a hundred prints using the fingerprint-like imprints of pots and pans that were used in nightly <em>cacerolazos</em> (a pot-banging type of protest in South America). The prints testify not only to the volume of protesters, but also to an elongated sense of time that a single photograph may fail to capture. Merizalde reveals the commitment of protesters to the collective good through their long-term interactions with one another.</p>
<p>In the months following some of the largest protests in US history, it’s become clearer than ever that there are serious gaps in traditional photojournalistic images of protest. By plotting a different path, compelling images of protest do more than just hide the identities of participants from a criminalizing state. They also elevate the act of protest by documenting heterogeneity and time, by turning the lens back onto the state, and by ultimately embracing a multiplicity of perspectives. Images of protest that intervene and act are uniquely positioned to negotiate both the street and the internet by relaying information between both spheres and resisting surveillance.</p>
<p>Still, in asking for alternatives to protest visualization, it’s worth questioning what we seek from visualizations at all. Why must a protest be documented and shared in order to testify to its influence? While images can communicate the importance of a movement, deeper questions arise about what actually comprises a meaningful protest. Is a protest’s power in numbers, in boldness, or in the change that it actually ushers in? Ultimately, asking what makes an image powerful is asking what makes a movement powerful.</p>
