    <section class="content">
    <p>In order to write a believable character, advised Virginia Woolf, an author has to capture humanity such that a contemporary audience can relate. This means that the style they use to draw their characters can’t rely solely on the devices of their literary forebears—it should respond to the current moment.</p>
<p>In her 1924 essay “Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown,” Woolf defends herself against a critic who argues that there are no young novelists able to capture “real” character on the page. But what’s real? she asks, and to whom are young writers being compared? In the past, writes Woolf, it might have been enough to describe the house in which a person lived, but contemporary novelists had to describe the person sitting in the room. Why? Because the “human character” had changed, and the proof was in the emergence of modernism.</p>
<p>Modernism, before it was so named, expressed through art and literature a changing world—the new human condition shaped by the gears of industrialization, the Great War, and new forms of mass media. Modernism was a means of visualizing the tumult of the exterior world processed by the interior.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, writes Woolf, something comes along that changes the human character, and the evidence will appear first in art and in the way people relate. And “when human relations change there is at the same time a change in religion, conduct, politics, and literature.”</p>
<p>The writer, keyed in to the importance of character, pays attention, knowing (thanks to modernism, we might say) that to describe an individual’s interiority is to describe the exterior world they live in.</p>
<p>The psychological interior—the inner monologue, the sound of that human character—is a dialectical soup, shaping and shaped by situation. Writing is like that too. It’s a digestion of the exterior through the interior, it’s observation articulated, and it’s a solitary act. The fiction writer communes with the imagination, accessing those tools that bring a character to life. In poetry, interiority is channeled into language.</p>
<p>Now a global pandemic is reordering human relations, as our safety depends on physical distance, and we interact with our communities via screens. Suddenly a relative one state over is as far away as one overseas, their images proximate squares on a Zoom call. We tour museums and galleries and zoos online. A parent who is able to work from home can be an employee, a teacher, a partner, a neighbor, and a sibling without leaving their chair, and a chair in a room once reserved for quiet reflection now serves daily duty as classroom, office, and community center. Private spaces have become public, and the internal has packed its bags and is waiting for the next train out of town.</p>
<p>The shift is both concrete and philosophical. Added to the fear and grief caused by the illness, the thousands dying, the hope for real racial reckoning, the despair of watching the government continue to erode as fast and deafeningly as glaciers in the arctic, is the stress of living this weird, boundless online life.</p>
<p>In poetry when a phrase begins on one line and runs onto the next without terminal punctuation, it’s called enjambment. The magic of the enjambed line is that as the beginning of the phrase pulls the reader forward, they unconsciously supply a logical conclusion. But the conclusion isn’t always logical—it’s associative, strange, and, when reached, often distorts the entire meaning of the phrase, or conversely, completes it. Consider the first stanza of “The Book,” by Rae Armantrout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The poet uses enjambment<br>
so that the reader<br>
has the constant<br>
small pleasure<br>
of thinking, “Oh, that<br>
makes sense,<br>
after all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without terminal punctuation between <em>office</em> versus <em>apartment</em>, <em>community center</em> versus <em>living room</em>, <em>mom</em> versus <em>worker</em>, and <em>crowds</em> versus <em>solitude</em>, our interiority is enjambed, beginning in our heads and ending somewhere out in cyberspace.</p>
<p>It’s the job (or the obsession) of the writer, and in particular the poet, to consider the affect of the external on the internal and to name the new syntax for the new self, or the new human character. For that reason they’re often called on to guide the rest of us through the tyranny of the times, to ask, as poet Ada Limón puts it, why we may feel a need to escape while already in isolation. Or what the absence of the party will do to the wallflower. Or why we feel a part of us has been lost when Zoom goes dark.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2020, I asked three poets, as spread out across the United States as they are in style and personal experience, what they were seeing in themselves after these months without gatherings, readings, or in-person classrooms, as Zoom crowds or extends their personal spaces. I wanted to know what it had been like to make work that draws so heavily on the internal digesting the exterior while the two are getting a relational overhaul.</p>
<p>“The toughest part was that I wanted to write, but I really couldn’t,” says Ada Limón. “At first I really just had to be in denial, and then I had to do some grieving. . . . I felt like silence was my only response. Stunned silence.”</p>
<p>Limón is the author of five poetry collections, and a current Guggenheim fellow. Her most recent book, <em>The Carrying</em> (2018), won the National Book Critics Circle Award in poetry. Normally Limón travels about once a week for readings and events, but when we spoke on the phone she’d been at home in Lexington, Kentucky, since the start of the pandemic with her husband, cat, and dog.</p>
<p>What is interesting to Limón is the idea that as a writer, what you dream about is space, solitude, and time to reflect, but when it was suddenly delivered this year, what there was to reflect on was “people getting sick and people dying and people losing their jobs. . . . It was overwhelming and brutally life changing.”</p>
<p>What felt like overnight, all the canceled events went online, and the requests for time and work flooded in. Though the messaging she was seeing online was, <em>Relax, do what you need to do</em>, the inbox was saying, <em>We need this by Friday</em>. “It did feel like the world came into my home,” Limón says. “A friend said it would be funny if we just left our Zooms on, and people could watch us do everything, and then they could remind us when we had a meeting. . . . That would be less intrusive.”</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/walker-2.png" alt="scanned and digitally manipulated image of threads, textiles, and mesh."></p>
<p>There is something curious, Limón says, about the collective experiencing of this pandemic, and the witnessing happening online. “It feels like everything is done as one big eye.”</p>
<p>For poet Peter Gizzi, Zoom makes him feel lonelier than he is when he’s alone in his room with his libraries. “I find it dislocating in a way that’s not useful,” he says. “I’m interested in dislocation, but Zoom is a distortion that I find to be unproductive.”</p>
<p>Gizzi is the author of several books of poetry and a former poetry editor for <em>The Nation</em>. He currently teaches at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and lives nearby, which is where he was when we talked on the phone and where he had been since March 13, when he had to fly back from London just before the travel ban. He’s back to teaching—now online—and doing readings over Zoom, which he finds enervating and exhausting. “I find Zoom makes me feel lonely. Lonelier,” he says. “People say I can break through the frame. I don’t find that I am; I find it deeply alienating.”</p>
<p>It’s the suddenness of together-then-alone that wears on him. “It’s like, click, ‘leave meeting,’ boom it’s gone, and you’re stuck alone in your house after you’ve put out all this energy,” Gizzi says. “Same for the reading. . . . Part of the joy of going out and reading is that you get a hit off the audience. I meet people; I like people. . . . What makes a reading great is that we’re listening to the poet listen to their work. . . . That’s the experience I’m interested in; I want people to listen to me listen to what I’m doing, because my poems are mysteries to me. I’m listening to them too; they’re giving me messages that I didn’t already know. I’m discovering them as I’m reading them. It’s not like I don’t know what I’m doing, but I discover other resonances in the act of listening to the poem.”</p>
<p>For poet, TV writer, and podcaster Tommy Pico, performing and reading over Zoom has been a welcome outlet, and a necessary financial support, in isolation. Pico is the author of the <em>Teebs</em> tetralogy—<em>IRL</em> (2016), <em>Nature Poem</em> (2017), <em>Junk</em> (2018), and <em>Feed</em> (2019)—and was in his apartment in Los Angeles when we spoke. Despite mostly staying in his apartment, he adds, “I have this walk that I do during the golden hour, which is about three miles. . . . My friend Morgan Parker lives like fifteen minutes away on foot, and sometimes I’ll hang out in her yard.” His interiority, he says, is mapped on to his twenty-four new houseplants—“buddies who I talk to and sing to.”</p>
<p>Before the pandemic Pico made a living as a touring artist. In April 2020, for National Poetry Month, he was supposed to travel almost every day, which, along with National Native American Heritage Month in November, pays for most of his year. “I was really scared,” he says. “My roommate had left to go back to New York . . . for fear of a travel ban, so I was by myself. I couldn’t get another roommate during shelter in place. My rent had effectively doubled, and all of my performing gigs had canceled. . . . I think that stressed me out on a cellular level. . . . That did not produce any good writing.”</p>
<p>Alongside the fear of the first month of the pandemic was the unexpected bliss of total quiet: no travel, no emails, no requests. “For the first time in years I wasn’t getting dozens of emails a day that I could never hope to respond to. It was silent,” he says. “And I was like, okay, I’m anxious because I, like everyone else, am waiting to see if I develop symptoms, but no one is asking me to do anything; this is wonderful, you know?”</p>
<p>Then Zoom culture arrived. Suddenly everyone wanted something and everyone felt entitled to ask. “Things weren’t geographically tied so we could do them anywhere, any when,” Pico says. “Everyone was asking for all of this free labor. And I was like, my rent just doubled; I can’t be doing free things right now. There is a weird entitlement because everyone is scared. It’s like, we’re in this together, which means I can ask you to do anything. Before I had the excuse of being on the road, but now seemingly I don’t because I’m at the house all the time. But that doesn’t mean I have no boundaries. Maintaining healthy boundaries while in a state of shock or grief or fear or denial or bargaining or whatever has been one of the ultimate tests for me in this time.”</p>
<p>For Gizzi, pandemic isolation has been an opportunity to consider our role as humans on earth, our place in time and in space. “I have a strange view of COVID,” he says. “I think it’s an opportunity for us to see that we’re just visitors here; this isn’t our place. There are things that live in the planet that are bigger than us, like a virus.”</p>
<p>One of the challenges of pandemic lockdown for Gizzi has been not associating the solitude with the two years he spent taking care of his brother, who was dying of ALS. “That was maybe the saddest journey I’ve ever been on. It was just profoundly sad,” Gizzi says. “I don’t write autobiographical poems; I don’t tell stories about my actual life. I use the emotional space and turbulence that I’m in to create something other . . . some kind of opening. Taking care of my brother . . . was a spiritual program, and I think it made me bigger. That was the opportunity there. And I wrote through it, which is a gift. Poetry’s been a gift my whole life. Poetry has been the one thing that’s connected me to a world.”</p>
<p>It took a few months for Pico to be able to write. Eventually he got commission work and a TV writing gig, and he started doing Zoom events to supplement his income. It was a nice way to channel his energies, and the transition to performing online wasn’t actually as hard as he’d expected. “As a performer . . . you can’t subsist on audience reaction because audiences change and venues change,” he says. “The reaction you might get from a music venue at 9:00 p.m. when everyone is drunk versus an overlit bookstore at 3:00 p.m. is very different. . . . I had tried to teach myself to get my self-esteem from the performance itself and not from the reaction. . . . In my apartment I wasn’t getting applause; I wasn’t able to look at a crowd of people, but I tried to center in my performance and in my voice and in my gesticulations. I found it to be a welcome outlet for all of the feelings that were necessarily pent up because I was pent up physically in my apartment.”</p>
<p>But when Pico realized there was really no end in sight to virtual performances, he grieved. “I’d been making do with these virtual performances with the idea that at some point . . . surely by August, I’d be performing again,” he says. “But that wasn’t actually in the cards. . . . I used to have such stage fright. Over the course of years, and basically exposure therapy, forcing myself to get onstage, I had to learn how to perform. And I came to really enjoy it, really love it and live for it. And the idea that I wouldn’t be able to do it anymore really, really kicked me in the stomach.”</p>
<p>Like Pico, Limón struggled to create any new work for months. But eventually she began to write again. “I think a lot of writing is proof of life, and I needed that,” she says. “I needed to say, ‘I’m here. I’m still here.’ Even if I was just saying that for myself and my body and my own heart—‘I’m here, I’m here.’ That felt important.”</p>
<p>One challenge for her has been learning to “turn off” and prioritize quiet when quiet no longer means being alone. “I’m still realizing how much we get our self-worth from action and doing. And I don’t think a poet’s life is like that,” Limón says. “We get a lot of self-worth from just being and listening and receiving; a lot of what we do is receive the world, process and filter it. And the less we are ‘on’ . . . I think the more our writing comes to us.”</p>
<p>Recently she had the thought, <em>How can I go away more?</em> “Here we are completely isolated and withdrawn from society, and I had the feeling that I needed to somehow hide farther . . . go where I don’t even have an internet connection,” she says. “If there is anything that I can learn from this. I’d like to do it.”</p>
<p>In isolation, time changes. Days are longer when they’re filled with an unfolding global crisis. As a poet, the mutability of time is of particular interest to Gizzi. “Time’s always been slippery for me,” he says. “I think it’s a fiction. This experience, this timelessness period, has only deepened my relationship to that idea. One of the things that poets do is bend time, transform it. I can create a present on the page, but it’s outside of time. Poetry is using language in an entirely different way. It’s taking the codes that we’re given to communicate and transforming them, to bend time, to bend reality; at least in my case, to dilate and find an opening, some emancipatory signal.”</p>
<p>Pico hadn’t written poetry in a while, but he tried writing a little during the pandemic. “I found that unlike the books I wrote, which were all about travel and far-flung galaxies and going to the beach and pizza parlors, that in the absence of going anywhere the poems were very short; they were clipped, encapsulated, almost haiku-like,” he says. “And that surprised me, that poetry in confinement, as it were, meant that they were very, very short, almost like impressions, because I wasn’t physically going anywhere. I think that’s how I have related to this idea of encapsulation, and the work itself mirrored the physical state that I was in.”</p>
<p>“Every day feels like an emergency of a different kind,” says Limón. “It feels like my daily habits are literally just trying to find breath, find some joy, find some warmth, and find a place that feels a little bit safe. My life has gotten very small. I can tell you the different birds on my feeder. And when I say different birds, I mean, ‘That’s the jay that comes in the morning; there is a different one with a longer tail that comes in the evening.’ I think that that has been my technique—to go smaller and smaller and smaller. While everything is so terrible there is some part of my inner world that seems to be flourishing a little bit.”</p>
