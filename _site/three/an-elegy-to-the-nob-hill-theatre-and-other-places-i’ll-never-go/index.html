    <h2>I</h2>
<p>The Nob Hill Theatre—a San Francisco institution that once showed gay porn, and that later became a porn-library-cum-strip-club—closed down in August 2018. As it was closing, queer publication contributors up and down the United States lamented its passing, calling it a “living and vital space” (Ryan Kost) and “another nail in the coffin of gay San Francisco” (Shelly Steward). I never went there when it was open, and now I’ll never get to go there myself. However, the Nob Hill Theatre is kept alive on screen, allowing the moviegoer to visit it vicariously and to understand where it was and why it mattered.</p>
<p>I first saw the theater in <em>Take One</em> (1977)—Wakefield Poole’s docufantasy about porn, performance, and the Nob Hill—on my laptop, despite several attempts to track down a physical copy. In the film, a man arrives to San Francisco from out of town and buys a membership card, which he’s told is a requirement for admission into the Nob Hill Theatre. This simple act reinforces what made the space so important—not just for Poole as a filmmaker, but for the theater’s patrons as well. For the unnamed gay man who’s travelled across the country to get to San Francisco, the Nob Hill is one of the first places to go. It offers safety and intimacy for queer people who want to see themselves represented on screen.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/moore-1-figure1.jpg" alt="a hand holds a DVD video of 'Take One.' The price of the DVD is $17.99 USD."><figcaption><em>Take One</em> for sale from Vinegar Syndrome, a film restoration company that possesses &quot;the largest and most comprehensive library of American sexploitation cinema in the world.&quot;</figcaption></p>
<p>This scene, which only lasts for a few minutes, foregrounds a lot of what was important about the Nob Hill and about the gay porn films that were screened there, like <em>Boys in the Sand</em> (1971). These films blend porn and art; they aren’t designed only to arouse, and some of them, like Fred Halsted’s <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em> (1972), aren’t arousing at all. Instead, they depict queer bodies, as well as the act of gay sex, to explore themes of place, power, violence, and utopia. In the 1970s, these films even crossed over into the mainstream (<em>Boys in the Sand</em>, for instance, was advertised in the <em>New York Times</em> and reviewed by <em>Variety</em>), with a wave of gay adult cinema following in their wake. They paid attention to queer histories that mainstream films of the time (and since) often ignored, making it clear that history was just as likely to be made in a bathhouse or porno theater as it was to be created anywhere else. Speaking of the Capri Cinema, an adult theater in New York, one man said to Samuel R. Delany, “I learned half the stuff I know in this place. People told me here how not to get AIDS—and I sure don’t got it. I get tested just about every year.”</p>
<p>These films are also tied together by queer geography; the idea that certain spaces, imbued with a queer presence or history—like the Nob Hill or Fire Island Pines—play a role in how we begin to form and understand our queer identities. This geographic specificity is something that’s seen most clearly in Poole’s breakthrough film, <em>Boys in the Sand</em>. In describing Fire Island, and the importance it had as the setting for <em>Boys in the Sand</em>, Poole says in the director’s commentary that “a lot of people didn’t know what it was like. They had heard of it, but never seen it.” For most queers who weren’t part of the wealthy gay Fire Island milieu, the space existed more in the imagination than in reality. <em>Boys in the Sand</em> straddles the line between offering up the fantasy and showing the place as it really was. It draws on the heat of the island and propels its narrative and theme through the act of cruising: making Fire Island the kind of place where there’s possibility around every corner. But this possibility and the idea of Fire Island as a fantasy space are rooted in the way that Poole continually returns to the water as a site of (re)birth, from the protagonist Casey Donovan’s emergence from the waves in the film’s opening, to magical creation of a boyfriend in a swimming pool in the second section of the narrative.</p>

<p>In contrast, Halsted’s <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em> is defined by stark, brutal reality. The film is divided into two sections, each with its own geography. The beginning of the film—after an opening shot that tellingly highlights the city limits of Los Angeles—takes place in open, natural spaces: defined by trees, views of hills, and water (one of the few places where any sex takes place). These features exist in contrast to the urbanism that dominates the film’s second half; Halsted transitions between the two sections by bulldozing the natural world away, replaced by a sprawling, dangerous cityscape. Halsted’s Los Angeles exists in fragments. The people get lost among crowds; sex scenes are dimly lit and full of danger. There’s no hope of escapism here, just the same echoing voices and anonymous faces, looking for salvation in all the wrong places.</p>

<p><em>Boys in the Sand</em>, <em>Take One</em>, and <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em> share a sexual imagination that’s rooted in the public sphere. In these films, sexual encounters—often outside the home, on beaches, or among the trees, sometimes with the possibility of being seen by others—highlight how readily available public sex seemed to be. But their geographies are vastly different, and the sexual identities that they generate are different as well. <em>Take One</em> presents public sex spaces like the Nob Hill as escapist, utopian, and safe in a way that the rest of world wasn’t (and sometimes still isn’t). <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em> envisions Los Angeles as full of queer sexual experience—but here, violence lurks around every corner. From dirty novels people find on the back of a Greyhound bus, to the ubiquity of dirty movie theaters, or graffiti that screams the word <em>GAY</em>, sex is everywhere, but Halsted asks if violence is the price that’s paid for it. Finally, <em>Boys in the Sand</em> shows Fire Island carrying a mood of possibility, even as its offset by the spectre of loneliness. Fire Island is shown as a literal escape from the rest of the world—one where fantasy is only ever a moment away.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<p>For potential thesis research, a (straight) friend of mine once went to a screening of <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em> in Aarhus. He said that the experience of watching it in a theater was strange, as he was always aware that people around him were getting off, even during the film’s more violent moments. He said that watching it in a theater with others changed how the film worked, and the extent to which it felt like porn. Listening to his story, I was struck by the fascination that a straight person could have for gay porn; he said that the film was about everything that interested him: critical geography, power, violence, sex, and class.</p>
<p>The consumption of porn has moved from public to private spaces as technology has changed (the rise of home video and the internet as a source of pornographic pleasure). This change in porn consumption mirrors the changes of queer life itself; the closure of queer public spaces (including the Nob Hill) forces queer sexuality into the private sphere. While this offers the safety of the home, it also turns queerness—pleasure seeking—into a more solitary experience, something mediated by screens and technology. Queer geography itself has changed, as cruising and the exploration of sexual identity have largely moved to apps and websites. The consumption of porn reflects this; it has been a long time since Casey Donovan emerged from the sea in <em>Boys in the Sand</em>, and now, instead of desire being informed by the water itself, it’s informed by an image of it. You can fast-forward, rewind, or skip past online porn—nestled among ads for Viagra, chatrooms, and hot singles in your area. The purpose of these 1970s films isn’t necessarily erotic, but as the current online pornographic landscape centers only sex, these older films feel almost like relics. While sexually explicit films with straight people like <em>In the Realm of the Senses</em> (1976) find their way into the Criterion Collection, queer films with pornographic elements don’t have the same fate.</p>

<p>I started asking friends of mine where I could find 1970s gay porn films. One friend suggested searching Pornhub to track them down, but they proved elusive—they showed up piecemeal in a way characteristic of the early internet. A Joe Gage film I still haven’t seen, <em>L.A. Tool and Die</em> (1979), was on Pornhub in four small parts, reminding me of how people used to upload recently aired TV shows onto YouTube. Films like these aren’t something that I’ve ever seen myself in; the men in them are too masculine, muscular, and sculpted like perfectly made objects of desire; they broadcast their S&amp;M desires through cock rings, shorthand in a language that I never learned to speak. I don’t watch these films so that I can learn to speak a new language, but instead to understand the things that are left unsaid. The lack of dialogue in a film like <em>Boys in the Sand</em> is striking; it tries to articulate things entirely through bodies, the way they join together and move through landscapes. It challenges the idea of silence, of what it means to refuse—or be unable—to speak. I’ve been silent a lot in the past, and that’s the thing that echoes through these histories, the attempt to find new ways to speak. As Adrienne Rich writes in “Cartographies of Silence,”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silence can be a plan<br>
rigorously executed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the blueprint to a life</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a presence<br>
it has a history         a form</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not confuse it<br>
with any kind of absence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“You don’t wanna mess around with those people.” This line echoes throughout the latter parts of <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em>, voiced over images of violence against queer men. The voice may or may not belong to a cruising trucker who kills the men he picks up and who engages in an unseen conversation with his next lay/victim throughout the city. The film challenges the narrative that aggression or violence is staged as part of sexual performance; here, sex and violence are distinct from each other—the fragments of violence that appear in the film’s second half are never shown through the lens of sex, just the act of violence itself. In fact, there’s almost no sex at all in <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em>. The final, masturbatory shot of the film is almost like a challenge; a sole performer standing like a statue, daring viewers to find pleasure in the things that they’ve just seen.</p>
<p>I didn’t find <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em> to be a pleasurable thing to watch; it wasn’t sexy or erotic. But I keep thinking about the story I was told about that screening of it in a theater in Aarhus, with the audience getting off to these fragments of violence. <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em> is in MoMA’s archive, and it’s difficult not to wonder if audiences there would respond in the same way, or if MoMA is less likely to let patrons get their dicks out in the middle of a screening. The institutional legitimacy given to <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em> is the exception rather than the rule when it comes to the afterlife of films like <em>Boys in the Sand</em>, which are often left waiting for a niche company to remaster them, constantly fighting the same battle when it comes to being taken seriously. Running against this is the utopian narrative of the internet, a boundless archive and an unchained id that throws anything and everything at you in the same breath. The transition to the internet for porn mirrors the move from theaters to home video, removing these films from the wider context of theaters.</p>

<p>If you search for, say, <em>Boys in the Sand</em> on almost any streaming or download site—barring the ones that specifically archive queer work—you will find nothing to differentiate it from the countless other videos that their search engines offer up. Maybe they’ll sometimes mention the year in brackets, or tag it as “vintage,” but the film itself, and everything that it stood for and accomplished, gets lost in the white noise of the internet. As scholar Linda Williams writes, in such contexts, “the text’s temporal context is even less apparent,” and the “sociological or historical impact recedes into the background.” <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em> gets called a “<em>~ hot classic ~</em>” on one website, even though for the majority of its runtime, it feels deliberately unerotic.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>The changing porn landscape feels like a case of <em>the more things change, the more they stay the same</em>. One of the most common and popular ways to find porn online was the Tumblr porn blog—now deceased, as much as anything can be online. The way it presented porn echoes one of the earliest forms of erotic cinema. Where Tumblr has GIFs, early porn films had loops: short films that played, like the title suggests, on a loop, generally in coin-operated peep show booths. There was no emphasis on story or specificity, just an endless repetition of erotic scenes in a short timeframe. The GIF is the digital resurrection of the loop, which takes a fragment of a fragment and repeats it endlessly.</p>
<p>I searched for some of these 1970s filmmakers—Wakefield Poole, Fred Halsted, Michael Zen—on Tumblr, putting their names into a search bar. I already know this won’t give me as many answers as it would have if I tried a few years ago. Very few GIFs from the films appear as results, and there are no real captions for the films, just a few cursory pieces of information in the tags: names of actors, like “Peter Fisk,” or a description of the actions, like “spit.”</p>
<p>My experience of working through queer identity took place mostly on the internet; I found that the availability of information online reminded me that I wasn’t entirely alone. Search engines are vital, helping give coherent answers to vague, half-formed questions. The internet is how I found books like <em>Giovanni’s Room</em> and films like <em>My Own Private Idaho</em>—a twenty-first-century equivalent to the young man in <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em> who finds dirty literature in a Greyhound. Online, I saw other people, strangers, asking the same questions that I was asking back then. And I hope that now, I’m able to provide some answers.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/moore-9-figure9.jpg" alt="YouTube Screenshot of L.A. Plays Itself. 20,796 views; posted on June 24th, 2008."><figcaption>Excerpt from <em>L.A. Plays Itself</em> on YouTube.</figcaption></p>
<p>Searching the internet for answers reminds me of Casey Donovan cruising through Fire Island in the “Poolside” section of <em>Boys in the Sand</em>. The whole world seems to be at his fingertips, and yet there’s nobody else there, no one to talk to. For all of the possibility and utopian beauty of the geography of the Pines, there’s something about it that feels isolated, like discovering desire alone in a room, watching something and clinging to it like a secret. Online—whether it’s porn, activism, or self-discovery—we’re together, yet alone. The way that we consume porn, especially queer porn, is something that captures the movement from public to private spheres, from communal to individual approaches to identity.</p>
<p>For porn, this public–private transition is about space, and what the spaces that we get off in might mean. That’s why I keep returning to the locations of these films. <em>Boys in the Sand</em>, a film that helped bring queer sexuality into the mainstream, could only ever take place amongst the beauty of Fire Island, just like <em>Take One</em>, obsessed as it is with fantasy and voyeurism, would need to have its climax in a dirty movie theater. The presence of the Nob Hill looms large in <em>Take One</em>, from the opening moments where the film’s name is presented on the marquee; the theater is where these fantasies are screened for the first time, and desire seems to creep off the screen and into the room itself. The places where we discover and define our sexual identities in part define our communities. Places like the Nob Hill are shown in <em>Take One</em> as a sort of sanctuary, a “safe space” before the term fell into popular use—from a character going to the Nob Hill immediately after arriving to San Francisco, to men holding hands en route to or from the theater. Simple acts turn locations like the Nob Hill into socially significant places. Emphasizing the importance of Fire Island in <em>Boys in the Sand</em> or the Nob Hill in <em>Take One</em>, is a way to, following bell hooks, “identify the spaces where we begin the process of re-vision.”</p>
<p>In Adrienne Rich’s description, “Re-vision—the act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of entering an old text from a new critical direction—is for us more than a chapter in cultural history: it is an act of survival.” The process of researching and writing this essay is, in a way, an act of re-vision. I look back through decades of queer cinema and porn to see old texts in a new way. Instead of purely thinking about their representative or erotic functions, I think of how they exist on the new world of the internet, where everything is available, everything is lost, and everything can be (re)-discovered.</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p>Samuel R. Delany writes, “The nostalgic approach sees all these silent red and green and purple window gates, these dead and wordless movie marquees, as the end of an era.” I found out that the Nob Hill had closed down while I was researching this essay, creating the strange feeling of saying goodbye to a place that I never got to go to. One of the first shots in <em>Take One</em> is the marquee of the Nob Hill, reading, in block caps:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/moore-10-figure10.jpeg" alt="Nob Hill Theatre signage reading: REEL TO REAL PRESENTS WAKEFIELD POOLE'S 'TAKE ONE.'"><figcaption></figcaption></p>
<p>This is how I’ll always remember the Nob Hill, captured for a moment in time that’s so specific that you immediately know when it’s from. Perhaps it makes sense to say goodbye to a place when it already seems haunted. The Nob Hill is captured in <em>Take One</em> in a way that feels perfect to me, a kind of refuge, a place that, yes, offers sex, but also safety. It’s a place to discover who you are and what you want. The internet is, in a way, a kind of sanctuary; for all of the talk about the echo chambers that pervade internet discourse, there’s something freeing about being able to log on to a social network and be surrounded by people who, in some ways, are like you. Even if the internet can be a lonely place that creates a kind of disconnect, its screen-mediated interaction and intimacy can also make you feel less alone. Whether online or in theaters, early gay porn reflects the world that queer men inhabited; Fire Island was—and is—real, and meant something, even to the people who couldn’t go there. The memory and power of these places risk getting lost, as films like these already get drowned out by endless landscape of online porn videos.</p>
<p>There’s something tragic about discovering these films after so long, when many of the people and places they show are already gone. To me, these films feel like historic documents punctuated by loss. To watch them now, to look at them through the eyes of re-vision, is to understand where we’ve come from, and the people, places, and things that have been lost along the way.</p>
