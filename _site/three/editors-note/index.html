    <p>You snap your laptop shut to leave the meeting, and suddenly you’re an island. There is no lingering, no chatter on the way to the subway stop, no knowing glances. You are alone. Physically away from cyberspace, your thoughts still remain within it. You think of misunderstandings—how internet connections lag, how face masks remove facial nuance, how your self-image fails to convey. You think of how virtual rooms nest within other rooms, how tabs multiply. You leave the house for work, selling commodities, educating, taking care of the sick—all for too little pay—enduring a constant fight-or-flight reaction to others nearby. Are you far enough away? Has your mask slipped under your nose? How do you avoid killing someone? Yet at the same time, more than ever before, you want to connect. You open your laptop again.</p>
<p>Our third issue of <em>Take Shape</em>, “Cyberspace,” stews in this tension between digital alienation and community building—a timestamped moment and a timeless concern. Mixing written essays and interactive virtual spaces, we aim to show that in cyberspace, critique and cultural production speak in multiple formats simultaneously, producing a shared discourse. What passes as online criticism tends toward punchy one-liners. These longform pieces instead take a slower approach; they range in tone from the journalistic and the academic, to the polemical and the satirical. With our first online issue, we hope to challenge science fiction writer William Gibson’s assertion in 1984 that the internet is always apart from reality itself, “a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators.” Intersecting with colorblind multiculturalism, early mythologies imagined the internet as an egalitarian sphere, a place where a user’s identity is irrelevant, masked by an avatar. Such fantasies that obfuscate structural failures haven’t entirely disappeared today.</p>
<p>Digital inequality is in part due to physical infrastructure. <strong>Cyrus Peñarroyo</strong> presents us with a diagram outlining US policy on broadband access over the past few decades. He argues that technical, legal distinctions between who is “unserved” and who is “underserved” continues to limit internet access for many Americans. <strong>Rob Johnson</strong> undertakes a guerilla corrective to this inequality through his work with the group NYC Mesh. During the occupation of New York City Hall in the summer of 2020, NYC Mesh created a free internet connection for activists uploading testimony of their experiences. Penñarroyo and Johnson imagine a future where movement online—and in person—is not subject to policing and enforcement of the “normal” use of space.</p>
<p>Particularly during the pandemic, cyberspace has become a physical place, as real to us as most of the “real” places where we used to spend time. <strong>Genevieve Walker</strong> interweaves conversations with three contemporary poets—Ada Limón, Peter Gizzi, and Tommy Pico. She argues that the literary technique of enjambment is key to understanding the current links between isolation, digitality, and poetics. Switching from the internet’s alienation to its community building, <strong>Ian Erickson</strong> enters Second Life to talk with the Sublime Reverend Goddess Shayna Theti-Sheri. Standing on a virtual platform in the sky, the two discuss the virtual recreation of Other World Kingdom, a woman-ruled BDSM micronation. During its existence, the virtual sixteenth-century castle was a sphere for alternative sexual practices. Niche online communities need not exist in immersive metaverses, but can simply exist in HTML and CSS. Web editor <strong>Benjamin Good</strong> interviews internet artist Laurel Schwulst, who creates online structures that center process over product. Together they ask: if cyberspace is something like a home to us, then what kind of structure do we want it to be, and how can we design it collaboratively?</p>
<p>While there is some room for avant garde practices online, tech monopolies surveil cyberspace and profit from the collection and sale of personal data. Similarly, law enforcement uses cell phones to digitally track people’s movements in real time. How do we as users organize against such forces? <strong>Sanoja Bhaumik</strong> attends protests for racial justice and wades through the clashing forces of US state observation, counter-surveillance strategies, and the lessons of surveillance art. She concludes that the boldest protest images turn the lens back onto the state, embracing a multiplicity of bottom-up perspectives. <strong>Annie Lloyd</strong> also sees the dangers of top-down technologies. Waiting at the bus stop, she considers how data tracking is used as a band aid for ailing public transit, amidst the dual fissures of austerity and the COVID-19 pandemic. <strong>Indranil Choudhury</strong> looks at the labor behind data, arguing that the apparently seamless operation of the digital cannot be separated from the immigrant workers that keep it running. He interrogates how the H-1B visa has legalized the exploitation of workers, pitting marginalized communities against one another to the advantage of the elite. Critiquing the gig economy, <strong>Jenny Rodenhouse</strong>’s interactive “RingGYM” app presents a fictional service that allows users to participate in workouts facilitated by trainers who perform routines through the fish-eye lens of a Ring doorbell camera. Ultimately, it’s a satirical, darkly comical piece about the lattice of relationships between “smart home” surveillance technologies, the police state, and the growing dependence of the privileged on the services of delivery people.</p>
<p>Taking our experiences of the internet seriously also empowers our use of it. By traversing the internet daily, we are carving paths into our personal cyber landscapes. <strong>Julianne Aguilar</strong> takes us to the world of Vana’diel, where Final Fantasy XI players once thronged in the thousands, but which now sits largely empty. Yet she can’t leave it behind, perhaps because she’s been there “far longer than the real me has lived in any one place since childhood.” <strong>Sam Moore</strong> also feels a bittersweet nostalgia online, albeit for a past they never lived through personally. Seeking seminal gay films from the 1970s, they learn that in the far reaches of the internet—among grainy porn clips and fringe repositories—live glimmers of a shared history. Transitioning from a queer past to a testimony of the queer present, <strong>Teresa Braun’s</strong> “Virtual Queerality” functions as an interactive nightclub-turned-gallery that walks visitors through the experiences and creative work of five trans, nonbinary, and/or gender nonconforming artists. The interviews contained within interrogate the relationship between gender and the performance of a plurality of selves, online and IRL.</p>
<p>Do pixels, servers, and undersea fiber optic cables add up to a consensual hallucination? What is the internet made out of, and who is its presumed audience? <strong>Thuto Durkac-Somo</strong> looks at the formation of the “ideal” internet user, unearthing the history of military research and video game development. He argues that the user is inherently a top-down, institutional construction. Diving into cyberspace itself, <strong>Marielle Ingram</strong> theorizes that the internet is flat, teetering, and full of junk. Like an ocean folding into itself over and over, the texture of cyberspace is ungraspable—neither striated nor smooth. <strong>Lydia Jessup</strong> also examines the pop culture flotsam of the internet, through a tour of the online social space VRChat. Along the way, she speaks with users about why they use VRChat, what social connections they make through it, and how they feel about its eventual obsolescence. <strong>droqen’s</strong> “Yrkkey’s Paradise” looks at how virtual spaces offer both a shackle and an escape. In essence, it is a game about a raccoon who wants to build a computer that grants them access to a whimsical, gamified universe. Concerned with digital dualism, it searches for a sense of belonging in a world split between reality and virtuality.</p>
<p>Finally, two pieces examine the slick, neoliberal language of digital renderings. In a work of fiction, <strong>Colleen Tuite</strong> and <strong>John O’Keefe</strong> write about two stateless siblings who make a living creating 3D models of plants for shady contractors. Tuite and O’Keefe imagine what goes wrong when precarious digital artists cannot maintain control over their work. Looking specifically to real estate renderings, <strong>Stalgia Grigg’s</strong> “spherical projection” walks players through an infinite, randomly generated labyrinth of eerie luxury apartment interiors, a dystopian critique of the horrors of gentrification and displacement. It draws from a vast reservoir of 360-degree photographs of Harlem apartments culled from software used for virtual real estate tours.</p>
<p>How might we use cyberspace to reinvent and challenge existing mythologies, rather than perpetuate them? These contributors suggest that the solutions to structural inequalities cannot be found in the promise of ever-evolving technologies. Cyberspace is often the office we are forced to inhabit for work, the area we are denied access to along race and class lines, and the holding cell where our every move is tracked by law enforcement with the help of corporations. In order to seek an alternative way, we must look not to better algorithms or more data, but to the artist and activist communities already attempting to forge those paths. We know that at its best, cyberspace is a community space, a free studio available to all, and a public space hosting the decade’s best party to date. Come join us there, in a new place.</p>
