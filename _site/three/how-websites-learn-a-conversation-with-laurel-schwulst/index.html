    <p>Today’s web has a crisis of character. Perhaps it is due to an unconscious identification with what is familiar and visible; there is a sameness when flying from link to link, index to index. Laurel Schwulst is an artist and designer whose websites feel like a clearing in a dense of trees. It would be wrong to say her work is nostalgic for an earlier age—rather it adapts the processes of the early internet to a new time. There is great excitement to be found in her work’s creative reuse of web elements, recurrent signifiers, and unconventional approaches to websites-as-metaphors.</p>
<p>Schwulst frequently collaborates with fellow artists. In 2013 she worked with visual artist Sydney Shen on <a href="https://perfume-area.com/reviews">Perfume Area</a>, a website featuring poetic-prosaic reviews of fragrances. Later, over the course of 2020, she worked with fellow internet artist Elliott Cost on a podcast called <a href="https://html.energy">HTML Energy</a>, where they speak with other artists who use HTML in surprising ways. Schwulst is also an educator, teaching website making through her program <a href="https://fruitful.school">Fruitful School</a> and as a lecturer at Yale. We sat down for a virtual interview, where I asked her about how websites age, about how we should understand web usability, about how we might use analogies between the materials of architecture and the language of web design.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Benjamin Good:</strong></p>
<p>How has working as a web and graphic designer influenced the ways in which you manipulate your physical environment?</p>
<p><strong>Laurel Schwulst:</strong></p>
<p>I’m not sure. I’ve been doing it a long time, so it’s almost hard to remember when I wasn’t doing web design. <em>(Laughs)</em></p>
<p>Going back and forth between thinking spatially and thinking about a website helps my work a lot. I designed a website for <a href="https://artistsspace.org/">Artists Space</a>—this New York arts institution—and one of the big things they wanted was for it to somewhat relate to their physical space, which has two separate entrances. So I used that as a major jumping-off point. I asked questions like, “How could the website have multiple entrances?”</p>
<p>With my project Fruitful School—it’s a collaboration with my friend John—we have a workshop for students. Before COVID we did it for six weeks. It ended in February, which feels like forever ago, but we’re going to do it again this fall.</p>
<p>We had a password-protected area for students, where they could have their draft work and view our class materials. One day we were sketching Fruitful School as if it were an environment or a house … so the password protected area would be like some kind of hut in the backyard. <em>(Laughs)</em> We were thinking about making a kind of model of Fruitful School, like in Animal Crossing. That hasn’t happened yet, but it could still happen.</p>
<p>On the web you can really experiment architecturally or structurally. Thinking in these ways is super important. It’s such a different feeling when you have to enter a password to enter a site, and that doesn’t have anything to do with visual design. It is a type of design, but it’s a structural design. And I would say that a lot of the important design work going on today—I hope that students today who are studying web design or graphic design really are interested in some structural approach. Which is what Ed Urcades says at the bottom of his website: “More often than not, the most meaningful human activity boils down to providing support structures for one another. In turn, the most meaningful ‘designed’ output is the infrastructural.”</p>
<p>That reminds me of a concept I really love from Christopher Alexander’s A Pattern Language: “intimacy gradients.” Basically, the concept is that architectural spaces are best if you think of them as an “intimacy gradient,” meaning: the yard is public, the porch is semipublic, the living room is semiprivate, the kitchen is more private, and the bedroom is the most private. Spaces should be designed with an intimacy gradient in mind, and applying this concept has really helped, because even though I share a lot of stuff, I do keep some things private and it really helps to create different types of feelings when you’re not intending everyone to view it.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong></p>
<p>And then the bedroom is the password-protected area!</p>
<p><strong>L:</strong></p>
<p>Yeah! <em>(Laughs)</em></p>
<p><strong>B:</strong></p>
<p>I get slightly offended when there is a password-protected area on a site—it feels somehow directed only towards me. <em>(Laughs)</em> It is really interesting to hear about this idea of a hut or woodshed in the back—the house is a recurring metaphor that you seem to use over time. I think it’s fitting, and the architectural metaphor is somewhat universal, where we all interact with it. I’m curious about your students and how today, with the internet, they are always connected. Do you find that it’s difficult for them to disassociate from being online? Do you think your students have a different relation to the web than yourself?</p>
<p><strong>L:</strong></p>
<p>It’s funny, because I’ve been teaching a while now, since 2013—about seven years ago. Then, there really wasn’t that much of a difference between me and my students. Even though it’s been seven years, I still hear students mention things like AIM and LiveJournal. And I wonder: when is that going to stop? I’m sure we’re not too far from students not knowing about that era of the web. I’m still waiting to be super surprised by students not having any concept of that world—like if they only grew up with tablets and didn’t even know that you could contribute to the web instead of just browse it. I’m still waiting for that moment of complete culture clash.</p>
<p>It is a privilege to be able to step away. And I understand that some people’s livelihoods depend on always being connected, if you’re an influencer or if you depend on social media for new work referrals. I’ve even heard a lot of my peers feel that way: “Why do I always have to be self-promoting—it feels like whenever I’m not self-promoting I don’t have work.” So it’s really tricky. The thing I keep remembering or wanting to tell myself is that there are a lot of people who feel the same way I do, and believe that other ways of communication and being together in online space are possible. And it just takes individuals teaming up and working together to move beyond that. I’m not saying it’s easy or anything. I delete Instagram every few weeks, and I even gave my password to one of my friends and deleted it for a while. <em>(Laughs)</em></p>
<p><strong>B:</strong></p>
<p>Speaking about personal websites, your work has appealed to me because unlike sites like Facebook where you plug in your information into a database and inhabit an avatar, you seem to promote shaping your own image on the web. That way we can all be contributors, rather than users. A big part of that is the personal site. I’d like to hear about this relation with personal branding, and what is lost when one creates a personal site?</p>
<p><strong>L:</strong></p>
<p>I think everyone should remember that whenever you post something online, even if it is framed as ephemeral, it may always stay online. This is because tools like the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine uses bots that are continually archiving the internet.</p>
<p>I think a good outlook towards the issue of identity online is additive. I think Kanye West said something like, “I am going to call myself a creative genius because no one else is going to.” Similarly, this is my mindset. I also am okay with changing over time, and if someone sees a different version of me in the past, I hope that shows the multitudes, or even multiple people, that are inside one person.</p>
<p>The thing you lose is that you’re not able to take things back, even though we might think of the web as an ephemeral place. You also don’t know who’s screenshotting it; who’s archiving it on their own terms?</p>
<p>If you start going down the rabbit hole of removing content of yours that’s online, it’s actually quite difficult. Even if you contact the person or people who own a site to remove the data, it gets cached in different ways. So you also have to ask them to destroy their cache as well. I’m not an expert on this, but I know that the European Union has better laws and regulations around someone’s own personal rights for data removal, but the United States doesn’t really have that.</p>
<p>I had a roommate who wanted to get rid of a previous version of their life documented online because it made them feel more free to have a different phase of their artistic career. That makes sense to everyone, I feel. There’s a potential to be cemented as something, when actually, what’s so cool about being an artist is that you can reinvent yourself.</p>
<p>I think there’s just a balance there of, “How much am I okay with?” Maybe what I actually want to communicate through my site isn’t content, but more of a process. And this is something I’ve been thinking about recently—so that people understand that if I redo my site, it might look and function completely differently. But what I was talking about before was that I’m interested in a process of recreation, circling back. You should kind of assume that I’m going to be doing this. And so if I were to give anyone advice, I would say: if you’re an artist, maybe you should be communicating your processes rather than your content.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong></p>
<p>I was just reading an interview with an architect who was talking about this paradox in architecture: that most of the work is building prototypes, which are never to be repeated. So that in the design process, we are often making things, and then regardless of their suitability to a variety of different situations, we have to throw them out at the end—whether out of a desire for novelty or not to repeat oneself. I’d like to hear about your process, and this relationship with novelty and resisting repetition. Should we repeat things that work?</p>
<p><strong>L:</strong></p>
<p>I definitely feel this pressure. I feel like sometimes it takes me a really long time—what I’m saying is, I feel a burden when I have a really good idea and then it isn’t able to be expressed because we pick a different direction. I still want to do something with that. And sometimes there’s a huge lag between it being first discovered, and it being expressed in a different project. <em>(Laughs)</em></p>
<p>I think it’s smart to revisit your old ideas from time to time. I like being advised by my past selves and am always rejuvenated when I discover how wise they are, when I might feel stupid in the present moment.</p>
<p>Personally, I try to find a good balance point between wanting a project to be completely novel but also just viewing it as a little piece in my ongoing practice. It’s really fun to have motifs that seem novel basically reappear in different projects of mine. And hopefully, other people can see that I treat that as a playful thing. I did a project called <a href="https://perfume-area.com/reviews">Perfume Area</a> with my friend Sydney where we reviewed perfumes, and it used these big flower icons—it’s the Unicode flower—and I’ve been reusing that recently in the website design I co-created for <a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/">Alt-Text as Poetry</a>, which was created between artists Shannon Finnegan and Bojana Coklyat. It’s not like I own the flower, but my use of it might be considered novel. I co-designed and programmed the site with Taichi Aritomo, and we made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUooHXD0JaA&amp;ab_channel=LaurelVideo">video exploring our process</a>, and how Unicode was a good technology to explore since its symbols were both described through the actual symbol but also language (each symbol's name).</p>
<p>Novelty is somewhat important, because I like my designs to encourage curiosity. I think it’s through a combination of novelty with some mystery that I’m able to do that.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as complete, unique novelty. What’s novel is just combining two unlike things that haven’t been combined before. And so you as a creator, someone who’s doing novel things, you should feel okay to grab one of those components and use it for a different project as long as you’re combining it with something else, and that combination feels new but also functional for the task at hand.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/good2.jpg" alt="a small figure out of white clay holding a cell phone sits surrounded by a group of dogs, all in white"><figcaption>This is a miniature sculpture of someone taking a picture (with their phone) of a group of dogs. It was created by Ayami Konishi, a comic artist and member of &quot;pe hu&quot; in Osaka, Japan, who is also my friend. I was a resident artist at &quot;pe hu&quot; in Summer 2019, and it is one of my fondest memories of all time.</figcaption></p>
<p><strong>B:</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of this idea of structural versus visual designs—do you often think of websites as libraries of content and collections of data, and, for instance, when there is a list, do you like representing it as such? Or is this an ongoing issue where you are trying to let the form and structure coincide? Is it okay breaking them up?</p>
<p><strong>L:</strong></p>
<p>Well, to answer part of your question, I love discovering hidden folders on sites where I can browse all the assets. The processes that take place while you’re making a site, which result in things like a folder of assets, also tell a story about its creation. Even though it’s not a conscious story that you’re narrativizing, it’s one that happens through the process of making. Letting some things live as themselves, like a folder of files, I think is exciting. It really depends on who the audience is. To give one example, the Artists Space site has these different subdomains—images, texts, videos, and artists—and that’s what I meant by the “multiple entrances”; these are different ways to browse the Artists Space archive. One of my big inspirations was accidentally finding an assets folder on an old site and thinking, “Wow, why don’t we just put this front and center?” And I remember Jay, who’s the director of Artists Space, used the metaphor of, “This is us airing our dirty laundry.” <em>(Laughs)</em> We’re just going to show all the images on the site here and, no matter if it’s a little logo of a sponsor or whether it’s an artwork, we’re just going to show it all. Oftentimes, you want to massage that, because one might think, “Oh, we don’t want the logo of the sponsor to be really big in comparison to an artwork.” But I think because we spent a while figuring out that this was an interesting artistic concept for the site, we all agreed that it was cool to air Artists Space’s dirty laundry.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/good3.jpg" alt="a small tinfoil horse sits atop a shiny silver box with a ripple texture on its surface"><figcaption>This is another miniature sculpture. This one is a horse made entirely out of a small piece of tin-foil. It was made by someone working at the Makawao History Museum in Maui, Hawaii. They said they sculpted these small tin horses to pass the time, and I could have one for free. I picked this one and have carefully preserved it for years. It's sitting atop a silver box which has an acorn from Seoul that I found on a separate trip.</figcaption></p>
<p><strong>B:</strong></p>
<p>For those who might not know, with each HTML element there are default stylings associated such as colors, borders, and margins. Can you describe your relationship with these default styles? Are there any initial settings you are particularly attracted to?</p>
<p><strong>L:</strong></p>
<p>I really like visited links, and how they turn purple. Just like in default web. I find that they’re not embraced anymore, especially in the context of web apps, because the pages are already refreshing all the time. I find visited link states useful sometimes, like when I’m on an index, and I’m clicking different pages. In an age of personalized feeds, I miss indexes. Craigslist actually might still have these visited link styles.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to make another architectural analogy. This question is about website decay and website death. There is a Belgian architect named Wim Cuyvers, and he makes a distinction between wood planks and bricks—wood is useful in domestic situations where the material’s inner flux allows one to reflect on mortality—the cracking and the twisting wood is perfect for a home in that it changes and degrades over time. While brick is more useful for a public situation, because it bears the marks of historical processes—he talks about bullet holes that attest to the events surrounding that institution. Are there any web features that you feel fit into either of these categories? Are there features for public sites that are more intrinsically public rather than personal sites?</p>
<p><strong>L:</strong></p>
<p>I’m not sure if the web is very good at decay. Actually, I wrote something on the fruitful school blog called “Designing for Decay.” In the post I talk about how negative operations on websites and social media are often “painfully manual,” as quoted from Venkatesh Rao. I mentioned a tool I’ve dreamed of on both Twitter and Instagram: a softer, more conditional mute. That is, what if you don’t want to hide someone forever? You just need a break for a little while; you don’t want to forget them entirely. Maybe this button could be called “time-out with a fade-in,” because it would hard mute their posts for a set amount of time and then gradually sprinkle their content back into the feed. You don’t need to manually give them another chance; by default, they reappear.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong></p>
<p>What are some site features you are nostalgic for, or that you feel have been left by the wayside and you would like to see return in the future?</p>
<p><strong>L:</strong></p>
<p>Some of the things I am nostalgic for are actually returning now, which is really exciting. To give some context, I wrote about how I grew up online being really into horses. Riding horses was too expensive, so I focused on collecting toy horses and model horses. There is this whole hobby behind model horses where you paint them and take them to model horse shows and they get awards. When I was in middle school, I found a community of twelve people who happened to be middle-aged women and we were in a private Yahoo group. It was a private forum where we exchanged tips and techniques for painting model horses. It was probably the best learning environment I had been in before college; everyone really wanted to be there. And everyone was so enthusiastic about horses—someone did organize it, but it was really propelled by the group. As someone who has then gone on to teach classes at institutions, there’s a lot of amazing things that happen in that space, but also there’s a bit of going through the routine and being part of something that you “have to do.” It’s the worst feeling if it’s a required class, and people are just there because they have to be. During COVID I see people returning to using online to connect with people they don’t know in real life. Like private Discords or even, in a sense, like what we’re doing at Fruitful School might be a part of this. But I still don’t feel like it’s as weird or specific as a model horse painting community. <em>(Laughs)</em></p>
