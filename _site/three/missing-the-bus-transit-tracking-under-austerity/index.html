    <section class="content">
    <p>On Thursday, August 27, 2020, AC Transit—the agency responsible for bus service in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties in the Bay Area—announced the temporary suspension of thirteen bus lines due to “conditions created by COVID-19.” By Friday afternoon, most lines in Berkeley had been curtailed or cut entirely, without any announcements posted at bus stops. This included the 51B, one of the most heavily used bus lines in the East Bay. In an attempt to compensate for the underannounced cancellations, a Berkeley resident <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11836036/a-man-on-a-bike-and-his-mission-to-warn-bus-riders-about-ac-transit-service-disruption">biked along the route</a> to inform people waiting at bus stops. The “conditions” alluded to in the August 27 tweet were, <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/08/28/most-berkeley-buses-wont-run-until-monday-due-to-covid-19-cleaning">as later reported</a>, the need to deep clean buses after a handful of agency workers were exposed to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Unexpected cancellations can and do happen outside pandemic conditions, but this particular instance highlights the precarious status of public transportation today. Agencies around the country are facing dire budget shortfalls from reduced fare and tax revenue and from the lack of broad federal relief for public transportation, besides $25 billion from the CARES Act (and an additional $14 billion from the latest coronavirus relief bill). Stuck between a rock and a hard place, agencies must simultaneously balance their essential status with their fiscal emergency. They are altering schedules, reducing capacities, and making service cuts, but also trying to enforce social distancing and mask usage and to keep buses moving. Of course, a solution to this would be paying everyone to stay home, but in the absence of such a solution, transit has to find a way to keep running. Agencies have been requiring masks, providing hand sanitizer, and allowing boarding through the back door. Many agencies have also reduced service, even though having the same number of riders divided among fewer buses can <a href="https://twitter.com/StreetsblogLA/status/1306740494311907328">hinder social distancing</a>. Public transportation is vulnerable on all fronts, which could have disastrous consequences for the economic recovery of poor and working-class city residents, as well as hinder attempts to transition cities away from car dependency toward low-emission futures. Public transit, and bus service in particular, already faced uphill battles in funding, maintenance, and service, largely due to decreased federal expenditures and increased local and state fiduciary responsibility for transit since the Reagan era. The coronavirus crisis is just a cherry on top.</p>
<p>As such, riders in the East Bay already took the system’s unreliability as a given. Local sources like KQED and <em>Berkeleyside</em> focused on AC Transit’s bare-minimum announcement of the service disruptions. Social media responses mirrored this attitude, with vocal riders focusing much of their ire on AC Transit’s poor communication. This is an understandable way of covering the problem; most day-to-day news focuses on events in isolation rather than on their connection to a broader structural circumstance. In the immediate aftermath, it is also reasonable to decry a lack of communication and inefficient alert networks. What this focus reveals, though, is a tendency to prioritize the ability to respond or react to a rupture in the system over the circumstances of the rupture itself.</p>
<p>Agencies and riders use abundant tracking and scheduling data to react to breaks in the system. This data comes from a variety of sources—both public and private—and is commonly interpreted by transit agencies and consultants or is rendered legible for riders by software engineers. The motivation behind amassing this data ostensibly lies in addressing the common frustrations of riding transit: delays, missing vehicles, changed routes. Information that provides the location and status of each bus or train in the transit network theoretically provides updates and alternatives for any type of service interruption, regardless of the circumstance. It makes little difference whether a train is late because of a sick passenger, or a bus is delayed because its route has no dedicated bus lanes—the main priority is a rider’s ability to see the delay in real time so that they can adjust their route and/or expectations. As a result, governance structures and individual citizens recede as the loci of collective attention. In response, flexibility and reactivity emerge as the primary affective postures to an existing system where precarity is the norm. Data accuracy forms a safety valve, allowing a transit system’s decline to extend for a long time without the bottom falling out. Riders are forced to become resilient by continuing to meet the system where it is. For example, if your bus never arrives on time, but a tracker informs you specifically how late it will be, missing the bus becomes a personal problem, your failure to take advantage of the tracking data.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/lloyd2.svg" alt="jumbled black lines in an abstract composition"></p>
<p>The purported usefulness of this transit-tracking data breaks down, though, when faced with COVID-19 crisis management. On-time predictions of bus arrivals lose their value when the buses themselves are not on the road. To cast these failures as an absence of accurate data and crisis communication is to accept the system as-is and to allow structural forces to elide accountability. Any large-scale change therefore exists in perpetual deferral, and in its place is an accommodating data set that aims to predict and respond to whatever failures inevitably arise.</p>
<p>These data and data-driven transit solutions presuppose an undifferentiated and flattened space. A dot on a map moving through space does not represent what, exactly, constitutes the route. Are the streets residential or commercial? Are they gentrified? Are they hilly? What ghosts and long-forgotten histories live in the buildings along the way? Is the route an old streetcar route or a facsimile of an indigenous route? Are any of the streets de facto segregation borders? The sedimented histories, social values, and materialities of a given street fade from view. In their place, the digitized map emerges as a common-sense representation of moving through space. The flattened space of mobility apps creates the conditions for data to reign supreme. A data-centric mindset ignores that a bus’s low ridership might be attributed to high housing costs that push riders outside a service area or to decades of service cuts. Extended headway times, crowdedness, and traffic delays turn into isolated problems that data collection is called on to solve. Transit system operability, then, is frequently measured through data-driven performance metrics, allowing authorities to discursively cast public transportation as a suffering public sector in need of market intervention.</p>
<hr>
<p>The ability to track your bus is a recent phenomenon. For decades, a paper schedule or posted map allowed most riders to formulate arrival predictions. Be wary of nostalgia, though; many bus lines are relics of streetcar lines that have been “bustituted”—<em>i.e.</em> substituted by a bus—and have never seen the level of public-works investment that freeway infrastructures have received. The pretracking world of bus ridership included many of the problems we see now. A major difference, though, is the simple reduction of service. After the 2008 financial crisis, many metropolitan areas responded to revenue shortfalls by cutting bus service. By 2010 an estimated three out of four transit agencies around the country had either cut transit service or were considering doing so. The postrecession economy has been marked by precarity, contract labor, privatization of public services, and increasing gentrification. It has also been the era of big tech. Public transit has been particularly vulnerable to these forces. Bus systems are now so vulnerable that fighting for increased service is a moonshot; instead, fighting to keep a bus system at all is the more immediate concern, particularly in smaller cities. Baton Rouge, for example, had experienced seventy-five-minute-long wait times between buses even before the 2008 recession.</p>
<p>One of the first tools for communicating real-time bus locations was NextBus. The company launched in the Bay Area in 1996, eventually expanding into partnerships with transit agencies all over the United States. Prior to smartphone apps, it made bus arrival times available via its website and through a call-in service. It acquired these arrival times through GPS-tracking technology installed into individual buses. Tracking in and of itself transformed the experience of taking public transportation. In 2005 Google engineers partnered with Portland, Oregon’s TriMet to create the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS, originally known as Google Transit Feed Specification). GTFS created the standard for transit data and led to hundreds of agencies in the United States making their transit data open for software developers.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/lloyd3.svg" alt="black line drawing of a person with the face of a brochure clutches his face with both hands"></p>
<p>It is important to note, though, that this data initially only included bus stop locations, number of trips in a day, transit schedules, etc. Tracking data only became available when agencies either partnered with a software company—like NextBus, Avail Technologies, or Swiftly—or built their own real-time tracking systems. For example, Kalamazoo purchased GPS for its buses in 2011; New Haven buses got it in 2016. Without GPS tracking, GTFS can only plan trips based on a prewritten schedule. GPS fills in the gap to provide real-time location updates. By the mid-2010s new apps for bus tracking appeared popcorn-style, some directly from agencies. Google Maps was also increasingly getting agencies to provide their real-time tracking information, starting in 2011 with San Diego, San Francisco, Portland, and Boston. Transit was never the primary focus for Google Maps, though, so there was always room for a more dedicated competitor to enter the fray with an app: something that could track your bus or train, no matter what city you were in, and that could adjust based on your habits and preferences. There was room for an app not entirely beholden to (and more accurate than) data produced by transit agencies themselves.</p>
<p>The two apps perhaps most dedicated to filling this role are Moovit and Transit. Moovit, an Israeli company, boasts the largest global footprint with a presence in more than three thousand cities worldwide. It was also recently acquired by Intel for $900 million. Transit, while smaller overall, has a much stronger North American presence. The Toronto-based app is available in over a hundred cities in the United States and more than fifty in Canada. Both apps are funded with venture capital, and Transit has even had investments from major automakers. They also partner with agencies, but are fundamentally consumer-facing. To find an agency-oriented version, look to Swiftly. It offers data collection and processing to agencies with the goal of making the transit experience more “efficient.” The data encompasses everything from real-time tracking to operator reports, which track the performance of bus and train operators.</p>
<p>Transit and Moovit use the same real-time data that agencies provide to Google and smaller apps, but they also use crowd-sourced tracking data to fill in where agencies fall short (or to create tracking data where there is none). They originally intended to be the Waze of public transportation, but their roles have since expanded beyond what Waze tried to do for driving. Not only are Moovit and Transit aiming to provide the most accurate travel predictions to their users—they’re betting on an integrated transit future known as Mobility as a Service (MaaS).</p>
<p>MaaS was popularized by a Finnish grad student in 2014, and it aspires toward centralized trip planning, booking, and payment across all transportation modalities. Within it, tech-cum-transportation companies like Uber and Lyft, bike-share programs, and streamlined public transportation payment hubs all coalesce around an ideology of mobility as an object of consumption rather than a right or a public good. The approach believes in a future where individual car-ownership will no longer have purchase, and instead, urban residents will pick from a menu of options based on price, speed, and convenience. MaaS frequently involves collaborations with big tech, as well as investments from private firms who see major market potential in the continual growth of urban centers. It fundamentally relies on buy-in from the public and private sectors, putting the subway and rideshare services in league with each other rather than in opposition to each other.</p>
<p>Mobility as a Service imagines a world where one app—with a streamlined interface and payment system—allows you to buy a bus fare, to hail an Uber, or to rent a Citi Bike or a ZipCar. Despite being distant from our current reality, there has been a push in this direction. Some urban hubs—like Chicago, Los Angeles, and the Bay Area—have established contactless payment systems, which creates the infrastructure to integrate payment with digital technology. (These payment systems are commonly run by Cubic, which recently bought the struggling company NextBus and is pumping money into rehabilitating it as an up-to-date tracking competitor). Transit has successfully integrated fare purchasing, ride-share hailing, and bike-share renting in some cities, but the jury is still out on the integrations’ potential profitability and traction with riders.</p>
<hr>
<p>These apps represent the nexus of venture capitalism, tech-heavy urban interventions, and the transformation of the city as an object of consumption. Because public transportation has historically held the mantle of an unassailable public good, these companies can emerge out of that nexus while still marketing themselves as uncontroversial contributions to daily life. Part of Transit’s popularity in the United States comes from how it has presented itself as the app most attuned to the needs of public transit riders. In over a hundred US cities, you can open the app and see the available transportation options in your vicinity. The map design and list of options looks the same regardless of your location. The abundance of choices varies—opening the app in Grand Rapids gives you updates for one system, whereas opening the app in Manhattan provides a near infinite scroll of bus and train lines—but the user experience remains consistent.</p>
<p>The homogeneity of this spatial representation across apps emerges partly from market competition and from the proliferation of tech-integrated transit experiences. Be it Google Maps, Apple Maps, Uber, or Lyft, a slick and responsive map appears for the user to make decisions about how to get from one place to the next. The 2D map as rendered through an app is easily taken for granted as a way of digitally representing space. They pull symbols and layouts from common street and highway maps, and Google Maps even highlights different locations in a way comparable to that of a tourist guidebook. The locations, of course, always seem to reflect your most recent search history or conversation with a friend about what new restaurant to check out—a personalized uroboros guidebook, where your recommendations never veer from what you already know. This naturalized, static representation of urban space transforms into a manipulable and programmable interface for charting out the best possible route from A to B.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/lloyd4.svg" alt="black line drawing of street corner, with traffic lights and street signs"></p>
<p>Besides flattening difference, this urban vantage point also centers the self, but only the self as a producer and consumer of ever more data and optimization. Even calling it a self is a misnomer. Individual people are not at the center of the app’s usability—users are. This data-oriented subjectivity is devoid of situated knowledges and assumes a frictionless engagement with your surroundings. You are assumed to be a responsive and reactive dot on a map, charting a course through the urban form, able to navigate any variation in the landscape with ease. The transit rider transforms into the transit user, whose control panel is accessible by smartphone. This subjectivity lines up with the lived experience of an able-bodied, white male subject, as no app tells you if a sidewalk is paved, if a bus stop has enough lighting to see well, or whether you will feel welcome in a neighborhood. Instead, this unencumbered vantage point perpetuates a long history of spatial domination. Apps designed to seamlessly transport goods and people carry on a legacy of white supremacy, imperialism, and capitalist development. Ease of access necessitates the displacement and/or reconciliation of conflicted, contested space. There are major differences, of course, between the colonial conquistador and the contemporary urban “explorer” who wants to move seamlessly through the city, but both presuppose an entitlement to navigating and defining another’s space. Contemporary wayfinding apps obtain their value through this navigational impulse.</p>
<p>At the same time, these apps also attempt to extend ease of use to the disenfranchised, but only if they willingly give up their antagonism toward the transit system as-is. Ease of use, here, is merely an aspiration. Texting a service for the bus’s schedule, constantly refreshing an arrival prediction on Transit, or compulsively switching between Google Maps and Instagram all reorient the discomfort and frustration of being stranded or neglected into the phone-as-pacifier. It doesn’t make the system easier to ride so much as neutralize its sharp edges. And the data that feeds into these apps, and that these apps in turn collect from users, benefit the app's marketability to investment by the same corporations that exploit urban space to their own ends.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/lloyd5.svg" alt="black line drawing of people waiting at bus stop, some with umbrellas"></p>
<p>Transit, for example, recently formed a partnership with Swiftly to improve real-time passenger information. In the press announcement, Transit’s chief business officer says, “Too often, bad transit data leaves riders stranded.” He explains how transit agencies that use Swiftly experience a “big improvement in data quality, along with a drop in rider complaints.” His comments demonstrate the consumer-choice ideology at the heart of a data-driven approach to transit. Data is meant to liberate the individual consumer, not the worker, human, citizen, or collective. Equity and justice are not the goals for these companies. While they do explicitly list a desire to transition away from car-usage, this stems from the unsustainability of a car-based market rather than any sort of environmental or spatial justice. The goal is to streamline transit and improve its technology in a way that competes with the convenience and market dominance of cars, making it unattractive for urban residents to buy their own vehicles. By obsessing over the possibility of data, though, these companies reify a misrecognition of the origins of public transportation’s problems. Bad transit data does not leave riders stranded. The problem lies in centuries of power brokers adjudicating who gets access to space, and under what circumstances.</p>
<p>A technocratic view might posit that the difficult-to-manage bus system will never work perfectly or in the service of every rider, so it is in everyone’s best interest to make the best of what they have. The status quo, though, is the outcome of decades of austerity and disinvestment across all bus lines. Accurate data and tracking information are merely a smokescreen—behind it, bus lines continue to face precarious futures. The stakes of sustainable and just mobility infrastructures are high, and the demands must have sharp teeth to cut through the data paradigm. Tracking steps in to try and remedy the ills of a long-neglected infrastructure, without dealing with the material and political conditions that created the problems in the first place. Fare eliminations, expanded service, reductions in parking spaces, bus shelters with shade and seating, and rent control (to eliminate the need to move outside a transit commuter zone), all present stronger possibilities for altering public US transportation systems in a way that might not recreate histories of violence.</p>
<p>Tracking solutions also fall into the realm of “optimization,” which is increasingly a city’s stance when faced with dysfunctional infrastructure, population growth, and climate change. This subsumes transit reform under the larger umbrella of techno-utopian urbanism, <em>i.e.</em> smart cities. An ideology more than an actually existing outcome, smart cities envision constant surveillance and data connection that allow for seamless integration of all forms of urban infrastructure and sociality. Smart city approaches posit that unceasing data collection will allow for better urban governance, placing the ideology in a long line of urban planning theories that aspire towards controlling an apprehensible urban form. Cities are heterogeneous and complex systems, however, and most attempts to control urban life assume normative uses of space and neglect, criminalize, or repress other ways of living. In practice, smart city approaches can often serve capitalist and carceral interests. For instance, LinkNYC Wi-Fi ports in New York City, which provide internet and allow people to look up maps or make emergency calls, serve as cameras surveilling nearby movement. During the pandemic, Transit is not just tracking bus arrivals; it is now collecting data on bus and train crowdedness. While this is useful information in a pandemic when physical proximity is an ever-present threat, it is also a form of surveillance. And instead of cities subsidizing increased bus service to prevent crowding or paying people to stay home, we get information that tells us how many bodies are on the bus arriving at our stop.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/uploads/lloyd6.svg" alt="black line drawing of bus."></p>
<p>A timeline of public transportation that positions its downfall squarely in its smart city iteration will not adequately attend to present circumstances. Privatized public transportation is not an unforeseen bogeyman in a dystopian future: it is the very condition of transportation’s emergence in US cities. Most bus and rail lines started as for-profit, privately owned companies. From the Pacific Electric “Red Cars” in Los Angeles to the Chicago Surface Lines streetcar system and the Interborough Rapid Transit lines in New York, these older transportation agencies developed into today’s semi-public systems. And even before a track was laid or a road was paved, European descendants in the United States have always charted routes on stolen land, inscribing the movements of whiteness and capital. Romanticizing bygone periods of public transit funding limits our political imaginary to false narrative: that the past was better than it actually was.</p>
<p>Data may represent the bus, but it is not the bus arriving at the stop. It is not the mom who is late to dropping her kids off at her sister’s house before going to work, because permanent cuts eliminated the bus line on her street. It is not the teenager who wakes up at the crack of dawn to commute ninety minutes to the magnet school, because there are no express bus lanes. It is not the packed train during pre-COVID rush hour, because there isn’t enough service to meet demand. Data will never transcend or remedy the preexisting webs of dispossession, inequality, and racialization that produce urban life as we understand it. What it might do, though, is soften the edges in a way that individualizes risk and responsibility and create a misrecognition of where power and potential truly lie. Tracking data dares riders to see how much neglect they can tolerate, and when paired with a consumerist future of mobility, it dares riders to pick the bus in the first place. For those without another choice, the minutes between buses will expand. They will open an app and see ten-minute waits expand to twenty and then thirty minutes, all while the Uber icon flaunts a three-minute arrival time. They might lean against a wall, while an ever-hotter sun beats down, eventually getting on a bus that used to take them to their home in twenty minutes, but now is only the first leg on a multipart trip to the only affordable neighborhood left.</p>
